        "content": "LONDON  European stocks climbed higher Friday after the latest U.S. jobs report soared past expectations. The pan-European  Stoxx 600  was up 0.56% by 13:50 p.m. London time, with most sectors and major bourses trading in the green. Oil and gas stocks added 1.28%, continuing their rally on supply concerns after U.S. President Joe Biden suggested Israel could target Iran's oil industry as the Middle East conflict further escalates. On the other end, utilities fell 1.5%. Automaker shares climbed 2.2%, led by gains for  Volvo  and  Volkswagen , after the European Union on Friday voted to adopt definitive tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs). It comes despite opposition to the measures from many European carmakers, who fear retaliatory tariffs from one of their biggest markets. Elsewhere, Shares of Danish shipping giant  Moller-Maersk  fell  more than 8%  before paring losses slightly after U.S. dockworkers and the United States Maritime Alliance  agreed on Thursday to a tentative deal on wages , bringing to a close their three-day strike and easing pressures on the sector. A prolonged strike would have provided a boost for European shippers to take a larger share of global supply chain demands. Maersk was last seen down 5%, while Germany's  Hapag Lloyd  lost 13.2% and Switzerland's  Kuehne+Nagel  was 1.6% lower. U.S. stock futures  jumped Friday after nonfarm payrolls data showed the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, ahead of the 150,000 estimated by economists polled by Dow Jones. Asia-Pacific  markets traded mixed on Friday following losses Thursday on Wall Street , with concerns over Middle East tensions keeping investors on edge. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index  extended its rally, however, on China's stimulus program, with markets on the mainland still closed for the Golden Week holiday. Back in Europe, earnings come Friday from U.K. pub chain  J D Wetherspoon , while France releases its industrial production data and the U.K. prints construction data."

        "header": "Yale's Stephen Roach: Markets are in danger of being 'whipsawed' by Middle East conflict, U.S. unemployment ",
        "content": "Markets are in danger of being \"whipsawed\" by the combination of regional conflict in the Middle East and rising unemployment in the United States, says Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center. The conflict in the Middle East escalated on Tuesday, with  Iran launching a ballistic missile attack  on Israel after its killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and an Iranian commander in Lebanon . Most Asian markets fell on Wednesday, tracking losses on Wall Street overnight, as investors fretted over rising tensions in the Middle East. \"The markets really will not know where to turn,\" Roach said, adding that conflicts in the Middle East are adding to inflationary risks at a time when global central banks are starting to ease monetary policy. \"We are likely to see significant increases in volatility and markets that really are whipped back and forth dramatically,\" Roach told CNBC's \" Squawk Box Asia \" on Wednesday. The Israel Defense Forces said its troops had started launching new strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in response to Iran's missile attack Tuesday night. It remains to be seen whether there will be lasting effects on inflation, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Santander, adding that the oil market will be \"affected more significantly\" if the tension escalates. Iran is the third-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping out nearly four million barrels of oil per day, according to the Energy Information Administration.  Oil prices had jumped over  5% after the missile strike before tapering to a 2% climb. Whether the markets' risk-off move will persist longer hangs on several key factors, one being the Israeli response to Iran's attacks, said Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBSGlobal Wealth Management.  \"If it's a measured response, not designed to hurt and kill at a wide scale ... things in the Middle East could actually settle a little bit ... you don't get this escalation of fears of a regional-wide war in the Middle East,\" he said. Roach, meanwhile, said the escalation in Middle East brings upside risks to oil prices and inflation. \"Central banks will certainly have to think twice about continuing down the path of further accommodation,\" he told CNBC.  The U.S. Federal Reserve projected cutting interest rates by another half point over the next two policy meetings this year, according to the central bank's so-called dot plot  from the September meeting . Traders are also looking to U.S. payroll data on Friday   for more indications on the state of the economy after the U.S. Federal Reserve's   jumbo rate cut in September. A higher-than-expected unemployment rate could prompt the Fed to accelerate the easing cycle to achieve a soft landing. The unemployment rate in September is expected to come in at 4.2%, according to data of a Reuters poll on LSEG, unchanged from the August figure. The unemployment rate had jumped to near  a three-year high of 4.3%  in July, a dramatic rise from the five-decade low of 3.4% in April 2023. Another element that could propel further market volatility is how long dockworkers' strikes at the U.S. East and Gulf coasts will last, Tay said. Dockworkers at ports stretching from Maine to Texas have gone on  a large-scale strike  over disputes on wages and threats from automation. It's expected to disrupt global supply chains and has  halted the flow of nearly half of the country's ocean shipping , Reuters reported. \"Any disruption of the port, any work stoppage at the port is going to have a very significant economic consequence and very quickly,\" said Peter Tirschwell of S&P Global Market Intelligence, warning that \"the longer this goes on, the quicker the economic damage will mount.\" Correction: This story has been updated to correct a quote from Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBSGlobal Wealth Management."

The pan-European  Stoxx 600  provisionally ended down around 0.4%, with most sectors in negative territory. Europe's banking index led the losses, down 2.2%. European stocks turned lower during afternoon trade following reports the U.S. had seen indications that Iran is preparing to launch an  imminent ballistic missile attack on Israel , one senior White House official told NBC News on Tuesday. Oil prices  jumped  more than 4% on the news. International benchmark  Brent  crude futures with December expiry were last seen 4.2% higher at $74.73 per barrel, while U.S.  West Texas Intermediate  futures rose 4.5% to trade at $71.22. Reports of a potential attack by Iran came as Israeli ground forces  launched a ground incursion  into Lebanese territory. Israel last week killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a bombing in Beirut, Lebanon. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed militant group. On the data front, euro zone inflation  fell below 2%  for the first time since mid-2021, preliminary data showed Tuesday, likely boosting the chances of another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank. Inflation for the 20-country bloc fell to 1.8% in September, less than the 1.9% forecast by economists and below the 2.2% recorded in August, according to Eurostat. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at financial services firm Ebury, said the print had effectively \"sealed the deal\" for a second consecutive 25 basis points cut when the ECB meets later this month. \"While President Lagarde indicated to markets at the last meeting that an October cut was not in the bank's baseline scenario, we think that macroeconomic data since then is highly likely to force the bank's hand,\" he said in a note, adding that an additional cut could be expected in December. The regional reading comes after preliminary harmonized German inflation data released on Monday showed the country's consumer price index eased to 1.8% in September , down from 2% in August. The reading had been forecast to come in at 1.9%, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Last week, preliminary data showed the harmonized inflation rate in both France and Spain also plunged below the ECB's 2% target in September. Looking at individual stock moves, shares of German chemicals group  Covestro  rose 3.8% after Abu Dhabi's national oil company Adnoc  agreed to acquire it for 14.7 billion euros  ($16.3 billion). Meanwhile, British bakery chain  Greggs  fell 5.2%, as sales growth showed signs of cooling. Renault  shares fell 3%, extending auto sector losses recorded in the previous session amid growing industry pressures and heightened competition from China. The wobbly start to October comes after European stocks closed lower in the previous session. U.S. stocks  were lower on Tuesday as markets closely monitored the escalating situation in the Middle East. Investors also digested comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell who said on Monday that the central bank is \"not on any preset course\" when it comes to the next steps for rate policy. He said to expect two more cuts this year  that is, a quarter percentage point each  if the economy performs as anticipated. Asia-Pacific markets  closed mixed on Tuesday with South Korea, Hong Kong and mainland China markets closed for a public holiday. Mainland China will be closed for the rest of the week for the Golden Week holiday."

European stocks had closed mixed on Wednesday as investors assessed the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and assessed fresh unemployment data in the euro zone that showed unemployment across the euro zone held steady on the month at a record-low 6.4% in August. Israel attacked central Beirut early Thursday, killing at least six people, as it pursues Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Israel began ground incursions in Lebanon on Tuesday and the strike on Beirut earlier today  comes after Iran fired roughly 180 ballistic missiles at Israel  earlier this week. Israeli authorities say there were no casualties as a result of the offensive, and that most of the missiles were intercepted. In the Asia-Pacific region overnight , Hong Kong stocks plunged as the China stimulus rally, seen after authorities announced a slew of support measures last week, appeared to ease. Markets in mainland China remain closed until Oct. 8. Meanwhile  in the U.S., stocks  dippedThursday after weekly initial jobless claims came in  slightly higher than expected.

        "content": "This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. India has long been the destination for companies in developed markets to outsource labor intensive tasks. However, several new technology firms in the country aim to gain a share of research and development budgets  money previously protected for spending in Western markets. Over the years, the services sector of the Indian economy has grown to account for 45% of total exports, up from 30% a decade ago. Business process outsourcing, or BPO, which includes customer support, drafting contracts or producing mass marketing campaigns, makes up more than three quarters of services exported by value, according to consultancy Capital Economics. Relatively low labor costs and high IT literacy has contributed to services exports growing by nearly 20% annually over the past two years, significantly faster than the 5% year-on-year increase in goods. The Indian government, meanwhile, has been eager to support the manufacturing sector in creating mass employment, a key economic and political challenge that the services sector alone hasn't been able to address. However, India has also long suffered from the lack of sufficient high-tech companies and jobs leading to one of the largest \"brain drains.\" For companies, one way to solve this has been to nab a piece of their Western clients' previously inaccessible research and development budgets. For instance, the engineering firm  Cyient  does research and development for 300 firms, including  Microsoft  and  Siemens , across several industries, primarily in the aerospace and communications sector. It has also begun expanding into the semiconductor industry  perhaps the most high-tech economic sector  to help businesses improve their design capability. Cyient isn't alone. Peers such as  Coforge , Larsen & Toubro's  LTIMindtree  subsidiary and others are also replicating the idea, which is now a $30 billion market and expected to double over the next five years, according to Kunal Desai, an emerging markets fund manager at  GIB Asset Management . These companies also boast moats that make them unique compared to the large BPO firms of the last three decades. Once research and development costs are outsourced, they are unlikely to be frequently redirected to another company or country. In effect, these companies become an integral part of the outsourcer. \"Once you're embedded with a company like Cyient, it's very difficult for you to strip yourself out,\" Desai, whose fund holds a stake in the stock, told an audience of professional investors at  Quality-Growth Investor  conference in London this week. \"These are sticky relationships that the company is able to cultivate, which helps reinforce the competitive advantage of the company.\" However, there are risks here, too. Desai said one key growth element depends on businesses in developed economies accepting that a portion of their research and development can be outsourced. \"Not necessarily the R&D, which is at the leading edge of what the businesses are doing, but the legacy R&D which they can benefit from the cost advantage of scaling it offshore,\" Desai told CNBC on the sides of the conference. If the sector overcomes its challenges, it will make a welcome appearance at a time of rising competition from businesses in countries such as the Philippines, Mexico, Brazil, Poland and Malaysia. Perhaps it could also address some of the risks to employment created in the BPO sector from artificial intelligence. Behind India's booming stock market.  The Nifty 50 index is up 17% year-to-date and has hit multiple closing highs. There are  several reasons behind its rally : public infrastructure investments, the domestic manufacturing sector capitalizing on companies diversifying from China, healthy economic growth and lower U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates. To capitalize on India's stock market, analysts and fund managers favor the banking and real estate sector. Consumer-centric companies listing publicly.  With India set to become the world's third-largest consumer market by 2027, according to BMI, the country's consumer-centric companies are lining up to  list on the public market . They range from vehicle manufacturer Hyundai Motor India's IPO listing, which could be the country's largest at $3 billion, to a $1.25 billion IPO by Softbank-backed food delivery platform Swiggy. \"India's growth story is now likely to be driven by private consumption,\" said Atul Singh, CEO and managing director of LGT Wealth India. Fabricating its first chip within two years.  India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told CNBC he's confident the country will successfully  manufacture its first semiconductors by 2026 to 2027 . U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD and Micron have  pledged to invest in India's chip industry . Goyal said he's \"in touch with the Micron CEO regularly, and they are making good progress.\" Domestic firms like Tata are also involved in developing India's semiconductor sector, added Goyal. Indian stock markets have fallen for five consecutive days now to reach a two-week low. Oil price rises due to geopolitical risks in the Middle East contributed to the 2.12% decline in the  Nifty 50  today. The index is up 16.2% this year. The 10-year Indian government bond yield edged higher this week to 6.77%, up from 6.71% last week. On CNBC TV this week, Ruchit Puri of Kotak Mahindrapointed out that domestic investors are more active in the Indian stock market than foreign institutional investors. The latter has poured in around $11 billion into the market, but domestic investors have put in almost three times more than that. That said, \" interest of FIIs is strong \" and they will probably \"put in more than $6 billion\" in September alone, said Puri. Meanwhile, RBC Wealth Management's Gautam Chadda said that as global central banks cut rates and inflation in the Indian economy recedes, the Reserve Bank of India might start thinking about loosening monetary policy. That will \"continue  providing a boost up for equities  from a fundamental perspective,\" he said. Engineering equipment manufacturer Diffusion Engineers lists on Friday.

The pan-European  Stoxx 600  index provisionally closed 0.95% lower, with almost all sectors and major bourses in negative territory. Autos stocks were the biggest laggards, down 4%. Oil and gas stocks were the only ones to gain, adding 0.24%. The Stoxx 600 ended the month of September 0.33% lower, LSEG data showed.

France's  Renault  closed 5.6% lower on Monday, with German automakers  Porsche  down 4% and  Volkswagen  around 2% lower. Shares of Britain's  Rightmove ended the day down 7.7% after Rupert Murdoch's Australian property firm REA Group  said  it would no longer seek to buy the U.K.'s largest property portal. Rightmove rejected a fourth takeover proposal from REA Group earlier in the day, saying it undervalued the company. The lackluster start for European markets comes after the pan-European  Stoxx 600  index closed at a fresh record high on Friday, as stocks got a boost from China's announcement last week of a range of stimulus measures that aim to boost the economy. Overnight in  the Asia-Pacific region , stocks in mainland China spiked over 8% while Japan's Nikkei 225 tumbled nearly 5%, as investors assessed key economic data from the two countries. China's official purchasing managers' index reading came in at 49.8 for September, better than the 49.5 expected by economists polled by Reuters. However, the print marked a fifth straight month of contraction for the manufacturing sector in China. Separate data from Japan showed industrial production i n the country dropped 4.9% year on year in August , exceeding the 0.4% fall of the previous month. U.S. stocks  were last little changed on Monday after major U.S. averages logged their third consecutive week of gains. Back in Europe, Germany's harmonized inflation rate  eased to 1.8% in September , according to preliminary data published Monday, down from 2% in August. The reading had been forecast to come in at 1.9%, according to a Reuters poll of economists. The figures are likely to boost the chances of another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank (ECB). Last week, preliminary data showed the harmonized inflation rate in both France and Spain  plunged  below the ECB's 2% target in September. Elsewhere, U.K. house prices rose at their fastest annual pace in two years in September, according to figures  published  Monday from mortgage lender Nationwide. The average property price rose by an annual rate of 3.2% this month, up from 2.4% in August, notching the fastest rate since November 2022. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 2.7% in September. Sticking with the U.K., the economy was  estimated  to have expanded more slowly than previously forecast in the second quarter. U.K. gross domestic product was estimated to have grown by 0.5% in the second quarter, according to data published Monday by the Office for National Statistics. That's down from a previous estimate of 0.6%. Economists polled by Reuters had anticipated the 0.6% rise to be confirmed.  CNBC's Lim Hui Jie contributed to this market report."

        "header": "A historic strike is underway at U.S. ports \u2014 and the impact on global supply chains could be huge",
        "content": "A  massive dockworker strike  at seaports on the U.S. East and Gulf coasts is expected to wreak havoc on global supply chains and the economy, with American consumers likely to notice shortages of popular products if the work stoppage lasts for a long time. Workers at ports stretching from Maine to Texas went on strike early Tuesday in a dispute over wages and automation. The action, which is likely to have severe consequences on ships carrying billions of dollars of cargo, is the first by the International Longshoremens Association, or ILA, union in nearly half a century. The ILA, which represents about 45,000 port workers, made good on its threat to strike at 14 major ports after talks broke down with the United States Maritime Alliance, or USMX, employer group ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline. The top-line takeaway here is duration amplifies impact, Lisa DeNight, managing director of national industrial research at Newmark, told CNBCs  The Exchange  on Monday. If this strike goes on for a couple of days the implications are, well, rather short-lived, Id say. If this drags on, it has cascading impacts throughout the global economy  not just the U.S. economy. So, the unpredictability of this issue here is really in play and it has the magnitude to really throw a giant wrench in global supply chains, she added. DeNight said that even a minor disruption of just a couple of days could have really significant implications for certain industries, including pharmaceuticals, auto and manufacturing. Ocean supply chains have already been hit hard this year by  conflict in the Red Sea , a lengthy drought affecting the  Panama Canal  and the  Baltimore bridge collapse . Even so, Peter Sand, chief analyst at ocean freight rate intelligence platform Xeneta, has  said  that given more than 40% of total containerized goods enter the U.S. via ports on the East and Gulf coast, the stakes could not be higher. Speaking to CNBCs  Street Signs Europe  on Tuesday, Sand said he expects the strike to last for one week. We see the dominos fall in multiple stages now. At first, of course, the immediate effect is on the U.S. East and Gulf coast, right? Sand said. There will then be a knock-on effect for vessels currently queuing outside the ports, he added, meaning their next journeys to the U.S. with new goods will be delayed. We will see disruption with some ships being late out of Europe and the Mediterranean towards the end of October and early November, Sand said. The ships will be delayed leaving Asia toward the end of December and early January  and thats basically when the next normal mini-peak in container shipping happens in the lead-up to Chinese New Year. So, its really crunch time with so many things at stake now. You might say it is a perfect storm, but it is also a really good negotiating position for those people wanting a strike, Sand said. For American consumers, he said the strike could soon result in shortages of perishable or temperature-controlled goods, such as bananas and other fresh fruit. Danish shipping giant  Maersk  has  warned  that just a one-week shutdown could take four to six weeks to recover from, with significant backlogs and delays compounding with each passing day. In an update  published  Monday, Maersk said the disruption would likely lead to delays in cargo movement, increased costs and logistical challenges for firms relying on U.S. East Coast and Gulf ports. A lengthy labor dispute, the firm added, may exacerbate these disruptions. Not everyone is as concerned about the broader economic ramifications of the U.S. port strikes, however. Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics,  said  in a research note published late last month that the strike action was unlikely to trigger any major economic disruption because  despite denials ahead of time  U.S. President  Joe Biden  would have little choice but to intervene and invoke back-to-work legislation ahead of the November election. Biden has said that he will not use existing labor law to force union workers back on the job, which is within his powers under the Taft-Hartley Act. Passed in 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act was a revision of U.S. law governing labor relations and union activity that granted a U.S. president the power to suspend a strike for an 80-day cooling off period in cases where national health or safety are at risk. Frequent shocks to supply chains in recent years have left producers more attuned to the risks of running low inventories, Saunders said on Sept. 25. It is therefore likely that firms will have taken precautionary measures in case of a strike  not least because the possibility has been touted by the ILA for months, he added.

Speaking at a campaign event in Savannah, Georgia, on Tuesday, the Republican presidential nominee said he would build upon the tariff policies of his first term in an effort to take manufacturing jobs from foreign countries  both friends and foe. \"You will see a mass exodus of manufacturing from China to Pennsylvania, from Korea to North Carolina, from Germany to right here in Georgia,\" he said in his mostly economic-centered speech. \"I want German car companies to become American car companies, I want them to build their plants here,\" he added. In his first term, Trump had imposed  billions of dollars worth  of duties on Chinese goods as part of efforts to rectify what he saw as an unfair trade balance. Trump has said  he would consider new tariffs  on imports from the country at rates of 60% or higher. U.S. allies could become a key target of Trump's \"America First\" policy that is increasingly grouping European and Asian partners alongside rival China. The former President has proposed blanket tariffs as high as 20% that would hit imported good from all countries. \"We have been treated so badly, mostly by allies ... our allies treat us actually worse than our so-called enemies,\" Trump said at a  rally in Wisconsin  earlier this month. \"On military, we protect them and then they screw us on trade. We're not going to let it happen anymore. We're going to be a tariff nation,\" he added. The comments echoed  statements Trump made  about Taiwan earlier this year when he accused it of taking \"about 100%\" of U.S. chip business. He also said that the democratically governed island should pay the U.S. for its defense. Trump has long sought to place economic and diplomatic pressure on U.S. allies, accusing   them of \"free-riding,\" and his recent statements signal he's doubling down on that approach, said Nick Marro, Lead for Global Trade at Economist Intelligence. Experts have said that Japan is also worried about what could be another \"transactional\" Trump Presidency and his  mentions of 100% tariffs  on certain car imports. \"Will that include Japanese automakers? So there's a lot of uncertainty here at the moment about what the next five years could look like,\" author  William Pesek told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\"  in July. \"One of the riskiest aspects of Trump's proclivity towards tariffs is that other countries won't take these actions sitting down. Retaliation by other U.S. trade partners  whether that be via reciprocal, retaliatory tariffs, or other non-tariff measures  is a potential consequence of all of this,\" Marro said. Trump also said on Tuesday that he plans to create his \"manufacturing renaissance\" through the implementation of corporate tax cuts, the creation of low-tax special economic zones and tax credits for companies moving production to the U.S. \"These policies could potentially attract some manufacturing back to the U.S., particularly for industries sensitive to trade barriers,\" said Stephen Weymouth, a professor of international political economy at Georgetown University. \"However, these plans are unlikely to bring about a broad reshoring of industries, given the complexities of global supply chains and higher labor costs in the U.S.,\" he added. Economist Stephen Roach also told CNBC that Trump's tariffs would hurt America's trade partners while only increasing the costs of goods for American consumers and manufacturers.This is consistent with  mainstream economic opinion  on tariffs. \"U.S. manufacturers who rely on foreign parts and components would take a double hit  their inputs would be more expensive because of Trump's tariffs, and their exported products would be more expensive because of retaliatory tariffs,\" said William Reinsch, Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump, however, has maintained that other countries will foot the bill. \"I'm not raising your taxes; I'm raising China's and all of these countries in Asia and all over the world, including the European Union, which is one of the most egregious,\" he said at his Wisconsin rally. Reinsch said that the tariffs, if implemented, would also represent a clear break between long-standing U.S. trade policy and mainstream economic thinking. Particularly when it comes to dealing with China, the current Biden administration has heavily relied on a coordinated approach with like-minded partners like Japan and the Netherlands to enforce trade restrictions. While the Biden administration has maintained most of Trump's China tariffs and even increased levies on specific high-tech industries, Reinsch described the difference between the two's approaches to trade restrictions as \"Trump's sledgehammer vs. Biden/Harris' scalpel.\" Still, the extent to which Trump's tariff proposals are genuine or more of a threat has also been a subject of debate. In an  interview with CNBC TV18  released on Tuesday, Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co, said some of Trump's top advisors had told him that the proposed tariff rates were more of a negotiating tactic for favorable trade deals rather than an expected outcome."

        "header": "Fearful of the 'middle-income trap,' Indonesia pushes for major policy reform",
        "content": "Indonesia's rise as an emerging economy is the latest of Asia's success stories. Yet the country's  Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati has warned  that its yearly 5% GDP growth, higher than the global average of 2%,is \"not enough for [Indonesia] to achieve the meaningful progress\" needed to become a high-income nation. Indonesia's ambition is part of what it calls the \"Golden Vision 2045,\" a grand plan aimed at transforming the country into a skilled workforce on high wages and a way to reduce poverty rates by the time it celebrates its100-year anniversary.  \"To continue our journey [as a middle-income country aspiring to be a high-income country] ... of high growth based on high productivity,we have to invest more in human capital,\" the finance minister told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" in an interview broadcast last week. A country report by the International Monetary Fund published in August underlined that the aspiration for Indonesia is to \"increase value added by moving through the value chain from raw commodities, build a skilled population ready for the digital age, and accelerate infrastructure development and institutional reform to support balanced, green, and equitable growth.\" Despite a change in political power earlier this year, Indonesia's ambitions remain.  More than 200 million voters in the world's most populous Muslim country went to the polling booths in February , ending a decade of President Joko Widodo at the helm with the election of former army general and Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto. The new administration will take charge in October for a five-year term. Incoming PresidentSubianto has promised to continue the charge toward making Indonesia a high-income economy.  Economic reforms passed through by the outgoing president will make the achieving Indonesia's grand vision easier.  \"Widodo put in place a bunch of economic reforms, the most noticeable being making it easier to hire and fire new workers. And they also reformed land use rights,\" Gareth Leather, a senior economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC.  \"Indonesia still does a few things wrong. Infrastructure is not great. Corruption is still a problem. But they're heading in the right direction,\" he said.  Indrawati hopes to avoid \"the middle-income trap\"  an economic development situation where growing economies stagnate at middle-income levels and are unable to advance to the ranks of high-income countries. Major policy reforms, she believes, will help Indonesia sidestep that. \"A lot of government efforts, including our fiscal budget, are allocated significantly for education, health and [the] social safety net,\" she said. The IMF's findings fall in line with the finance minister. TheWashington-based institution said achieving high-income status will require \"broad and sustained structural\" reforms, while also securing the economic stability that has already been built up. A  report published in July by the Lowy Institute , an Australian-based business think tank, noted the gains that have already been achieved, stating that the country'sdigitalization of social welfare programs, as well as subsidized food and energy initiatives, have \"coincided with a significant reduction in poverty, with less than 10%of the country's 279 million residents living below the international poverty line by 2023.\" Taxation and labor reforms, making it easier for firms to hire and fire workers, are also a strategic part of Indonesia's economic engineering. \"They're useful steps in the right direction,\" said Leather.  \"Under the old system, if you wanted to sack a worker in Indonesia, you had to pay them up to 60 weeks of severance pay. Which is way more than anywhere else. If you're a manufacturing investor looking at where to set up shop in Asia, and you see how inflexible the labor force is, it could put you off.\"  Leather feels \"relatively upbeat about Indonesia,\" though \"it won't ever be the next China,\" he told CNBC.\"If it continues growing at 5-6% over the next decade, that's a decent performance,\" he added. Indrawati, meanwhile, remains cautious. \"A lot of work still needs to be done,\" said the minister, adding that a lot had been achieved \"despite Covid and geopolitical fragmentation.\" A key goal is for Indonesia to remain politically non-aligned through its economic policy, despite growing pressures of war in Ukraine and Gaza. \"Despite geopolitical tensions and fragmentation, Indonesia can nurture its domestic [growth]\" and must be \"opportunistic\" in increasingdemand within the chip industry and electric vehicle battery production, said the finance minister."

        "content": "LONDON  European stocks closed slightly lower Wednesday following a choppy session, as a China-fuelled rally lost steam. The pan-European  Stoxx 600  ended down 0.11%, with sectors and major bourses pointing in opposite directions. Europe's banking index closed 0.73% lower as market participants spent the day closely monitoring  UniCredit 's  swoop  for Commerzbank , Germany's second-largest lender. Milan-based UniCredit announced on Monday that it had increased its stake in Commerzbank to around 21% and submitted a request to boost that holding to up to 29.9%. It follows UniCredit's move to take a 9% stake in Commerzbank earlier this month. Shares of Commerzbank, which  announced  Wednesday that Bettina Orlopp will take over as chief executive officer in the near future, added 0.82%. Looking at individual stock moves, Finnish engineering company  Valmet  surged to the top of the European benchmark. It comes after the firm  received an order  valued at roughly 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) from a pulp mill in Brazil. Shares of Valmet ended nearly 12% higher on the news. German software developer  SAP  tumbled toward the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after Bloomberg  reported  Tuesday that, among others, the company is under investigation in the U.S. over price-fixing allegations. Shares closed down 2.4%. Elsewhere, Sweden's Riksbank on Wednesday  cut interest rates  by 25 basis points to 3.25% and suggested the policy rate could be reduced further at the two remaining monetary policy meetings this year. Sweden's central bank said a rate cut of 50 basis points is possible at one of these meetings. One basis point equals 0.01%. European stocks closed 0.6% higher on Tuesday, buoyed by China's central bank  monetary stimulus measures  with mining, technology and household goods the best-performing sectors. The People's Bank of China said the central bank would  cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks by 50 basis points, although it did not provide a specific timeline. The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Wednesday  sharply upgraded  Britain's economic growth prospects. The OECD said it expects the U.K. economy to expand by 1.1% this year and 1.2% next year. That's up from previous forecasts of 0.4% growth in 2024 and 1% in 2025. The revisions come after the OECD  said in May  that the U.K. was likely on course to become the worst-performing economy of all advanced nations next year. Britain's FTSE 100 index traded 0.3% higher on the news, but slipped below the flatline by the close of trade. Asia-Pacific markets  were largely range-bound overnight, although Hong Kong's Hang Seng index extended its rally and climbed 2.2% on the back of the announced stimulus, while mainland China's CSI 300 recorded its largest one-day gain in over four years. U.S. stocks  were little changed in early deals Wednesday. The major three averages are on track for a positive month, though concerns that the U.S. economy could be slowing down remain after last week's interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve."

        "header": "Op-ed: The UK's budget problems date back to the 2008 financial crisis",
        "content": "Over the past few weeks, economic news from the U.K. has heavily focused on the state of British national finances and how they might impact both the British public and the prospects for economic growth. A number of accusations and denials have flown between the rival Labour and Conservative parties over the state of the country's budget deficit, particularly between current and former finance ministers Rachel Reeves and Jeremy Hunt. Regardless of how the U.K. fiscal situation stands now, it is clear that the current shortfalls are both years in the making and run the risk of having consequences that could last for years to come. The ultimate dilemma facing Labour now is that the country cannot produce enough revenue to close systemic shortfalls without sustained economic growth, but it also cannot create economic growth without real investment, both from the public and private sectors. In many ways, the current fiscal situation dates back to the financial crisis of 2008 and the fact that the country's economy was unable to snap back readily to close the budget shortfalls that occurred then. When U.K. revenues failed to recover, the Conservative government of the time chose to implement austerity measures, temporarily cutting back on public investment in everything ranging from infrastructure to public health and social services. The problem lies in the fact that these measures, sold as a short-term solution, still remain and that the cost of the continued ageing of the U.K. population, the burden of  Brexit  on everything ranging from small business exporters to the financial sector, and continued sluggish economic growth mean that any options available for the current Labour government are and remain limited. One thing that the U.K. government clearly cannot do, unlike countries such as the United States, China, or Japan, is run large-scale deficits, either by increasing spending or by further cutting taxes.  Borrowing in the financial year to August stood at 64.1 billion  ($85 billion), with the country's debt hitting 100% of GDP. For decades, Britain was considered one of the world's reserve currencies, but with all of the benefits it granted, recent events have reinforced this to no longer be the case. The reaction of the bond markets to then  Prime Minister Liz Truss' proposed budget  of 2022 showed that the private sector would not support any significant deficit spending, particularly from tax cuts. At the same time, both Labour and Conservative leaders are keenly aware of the limited financial resources currently available to fund public programs. One well-known argument put forward in favor of Brexit was the fact that money being sent to the European Union could be used to restore funding to the beleaguered National Health Service. In recent days, in advance of the Labour Party Conference that kicked off Monday and next month's release of the first budget of the new Labour government, concerns about new levels of austerity have become widespread. Recent coverage of potential cuts of the winter fuel benefits for U.K. pensioners and a recent House of Lords report on the unsustainability of current budget deficits have only further raised concerns. The new Labour government has taken great pains that they are not planning to implement further austerity on public services,  underlined by Reeves' keynote speech on Monday afternoon. The key question then, not just for the party conference, but also for Labour plans going forward is how to address the need for greater investment in the public sphere, especially in services and infrastructure, while also drawing significantly greater private sector investment into the country to help address shortfalls in both revenue and economic opportunity. One sign of possible solutions has come from the government's proposed aim of using private development monies to help complete the HS2 rail line into an upgraded Euston Station in London. Any such partnerships will need to find ways to benefit both the investors and the public in order to avoid repeats of the poorly implemented privatizations such as those with Railtrack and Thames Water. Other possibilities could focus on further efforts to remove red tape and improve trade efficiencies with continental Europe in the wake of Brexit. Multiple global businesses have expressed frustration with maintaining their supply chains in the wake of border delays and unclear rules implementation. The final possibility, which has been so far dismissed by the new government, is to raise taxes. Both businesses and markets may well tolerate tax increases if they can see the value for the money they pay in terms of improved services and business infrastructure. Ultimately, the private sector will be looking for a clear long-term plan for execution, whether in tax and fiscal policy or in courting and building long-term public-private partnerships. If Labour can execute in that regard, it will go far in helping to establish a stronger environment for public confidence in its economic plans for the next several years.

        "header": "CNBC's Inside India newsletter: Can India grow as fast as China did?",
        "content": "This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. The big banks of Wall Street have been quick to tweak what they expect from Indian growth this year. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank have all entertained the idea that India's economic expansion might be lower than what was previously expected. The country's GDP figure slowed to a 15-month low of 6.7% year-on-year in the second calendar quarter. Yet, India's central bank appeared to dismiss the negativity earlier this month and reiterated its bullish view of India's growth rate, still expecting the economy to grow by 7.2%. When asked by CNBC's Tanvir Gill whether there were any downside risks to this prediction, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India responded with an emphatic \"no.\" \"Not at all.\" \"We are quite confident about the 7.2% growth which we have projected in our current year's assessment,\" Shaktikanta Das said in an  exclusive interview for CNBC . \"The underlying momentum is very strong and is not driven by some seasonal factors or one off factors. The growth momentum in India is very strong and it is primarily attributable to structural factors.\" Das pointed to data showing that consumer spending, which makes up about 60% of GDP, rose to 7.4% in the second calendar quarter, compared to 4% in the previous quarter. Similarly, construction continued to expand at 10.5% for the same period. The agriculture sector, which grew by 2.2%, was held back by a delayed monsoon but has since recovered. The \"only component\" that slowed down, according to the governor, was government expenditure amid the election season. \"Going forward, I would expect the budgeted amounts will be spent by the central and the state governments, and then they will be able to catch up,\" he added. Not only did Das stick to his guns on India's near-term growth prospect, he was also bullish about the medium-term trajectory, expecting GDP to expand by more than 7.5% annually. \"It can be between 7.5% to 8%, I'd like to say,\" Das added. \"But on a conservative basis: seven and a half.\" However, when prompted on whether India's growth rate could compete with what China has already achieved for over two decades, the governor was less buoyant. The growth rate is politically important for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he's set out his vision to make India a developed economy by 2047  a mere 23 years away and when India will log a whole century as an independent nation. Meanwhile, China, now  an upper-middle-income country , has grown by more than 10% annually for more than 22 years since the 1960s, according to CNBC's count of World Bank data. India has never managed to achieve that feat. \"I think a 7.5% to 8% growth will not pose sustainability concerns. I think it can be sustainable. But if you are looking at 10-plus growth, before I venture into that, I have to really do my homework much more,\" Governor Das said. One key element behind the central bank's bullish near-term view has been investors and businesses pouring money into India to either ride the growth story or diversify away from China. That may be about change as China steps up measures to once again compete for investments headed for emerging markets. This week,  China's central bank, President Xi Jinping and other top leaders  announced plans to boost the country's economy and attract investment. Just hours after the announcements, billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper of Appaloosa Management told CNBC that he'd taken a  limit-less bet on China without any hedges , buying just about \"everything.\" Similarly, investment bank Barclays' strategists have turned bullish on China in the near term. \"Renewed stimulus hope + a global laggards rally + marginal sentiment improvement amid low positioning is setting China stocks up for potentially the second major breakout for the year,\" said strategist Kaanhari Singh in a note to clients. \"We would favor China shares over Indian equities into October.\" If India intends to grow as fast as China did,it may have to get a move on. India rules out joining world's largest trade deal.  \"India is not going to join the RCEP because neither did it reflect the guiding principles on which ASEAN was started, nor is it in the nation's interest to do a free trade agreement with China,\" India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal told CNBC's Tanvir Gill in  an interview this week . The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed in 2020 by 15 Asia-Pacific countries that comprise 30% of global GDP. Watch the full interview with Goyal  here . Indian startup Physics Wallah hits a $2.8 billion valuation.  Venture capital firms, led by Hornbill Capital and involving Lightspeed Venture Partners, GSV and WestBridge, poured $210 million into the education technology startup on Friday. That puts its  valuation at $2.8 billion , far outstripping its last valuation of $1.1 billion. Physics Wallah offers free and paid-for courses  that on average cost less than $50  for examinations in India. Help in becoming a semiconductor powerhouse.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants the country's electronics sector to grow from $155 billion today to $500 billion by 2030  and the semiconductor industry will be a major factor in that. Industry experts are divided on whether that goal is realistic. But they are unanimous in saying India needs  external help to kickstart this venture . New realities for Indian banks.  Former State Bank of India chief Arundhati Bhattacharya told CNBC-TV18  India's era of deposit-led banking is over . With rising affluence in the country, a younger demographic of Indian investors are deploying their cash to low-risk assets rather than saving their money in banks. \"Our treasuries really need to tone up to understand how they should balance assets and liabilities,\" Bhattacharya said. Dimon says India poised to take advantage of U.S.-China tension . JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon  cautioned that any \"China +1\" transition will take years  as firms navigate the complexities of relocating operations. \"It has just started, it would take years  you're talking about 5, 10, 15 years. So even if it's going to take place, it's going to take a long time,\" he told CNBC-TV18. Avoid making mistakes when investing in India [subscribers content].

The Indian stock market is on a tear. The  Nifty 50  is now firmly above 26,000 points to hit yet another record high. The index is up 1.6% for the week but up 20.64% so far this year. The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield ticked lower this week to 6.71%, from 6.75% this time last week. On CNBC TV week, Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at JPMorgan, told CNBC India's \"current account deficit has been very behaved and very benign.\" The bank expects India's deficit this year to be around 1.2% of GDP, which is very sustainable. Furthermore, India's foreign exchange reserves has allowed it to have a  degree of monetary policy independence . Raamdeo Agrawal, the chairman and co-founder of Motilal Oswal Financial Services,  weighed in on the country's investment landscape . He said  India's bull run is in \"full swing\"  but will become \"much bigger,\" predicting the Nifty 50 to reach 50,000 points by 2030.

        "content": "Etihad Airways on Wednesday revealed a $7 billion investment plan over the next five years in a bid to \"double the size of the airline until 2030.\" Speaking to CNBC's Dan Murphy, Etihad's Group Chief Executive Officer Antonoaldo Neves revealed passengers should expect \"a totally different airline\" within the next two to three years. Much of the $7 billion will go into revamping its existing fleet of planes, as well as the purchase of new aircraft further down the line, he said. The Abu Dhabi-based airline currently has 92 planes operating. But Neves is aiming for the skies, with the hope of having up to 170 planes by the end of the decade. The expanded network of planes will allow the company to offer more \"convenient\" time slots for passengers traveling to Europe and Southeast Asia who want to travel at 2 p.m. in the afternoon rather than in the early hours of the morning, he said. Neves said Etihad will begin retrofitting and revamping \"dated\" Boeing 777 planes from 2026 onward, this is due to what he described as \"the constraints that we have in the global aviation market.\" \"There are no planes available,\" he said. The purchase of new planes, the retrofitting of the Boeing 777s, boosting the number of business class seats and replacing existing in-flight WiFi with stronger connectivity are all priorities for the United Arab Emirates-based airline. \"Theproduct is extremely important, and customer service extremely important,\" said Neves. The opening of  Abu Dhabi's new terminal in November last year , which Etihad now operates over 100 flights a day from, has already strengthened the company's competitive advantage, Neves believes. Two years ago, the airline saw 10 million passengers onboard. Since the start of the year, the airline has already had 18 million passengers. A drive to improve profitability comes amid speculation about a possible IPO in 2025. Neves said no decision has been made on when, not if, the airline goes to market. \"It's really important for airlines to be listed, right? Because in the end, although we don't need cash in the next five to six years to deploy the $7 billion capital. One day, if we decide to accelerate, to grow even more, we may need capital and having the ability to tap into different sources of capital to finance our growth may be important in the future,\" said Neves. Etihad is \"working hard to be ready\" for an IPO listing, adding that it was \"no secret to anyone\" that the firm's sovereign wealth fund shareholder ADQ, fully owned by the Abu Dhabi government, is \"investing very heavily in their companies to be ready to lead to be listed.\" ADQ is the smallest of Abu Dhabi's three sovereign wealth funds and is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the brother of the UAE's current president. In a report  published by Reuters , Etihad Airways could make its stock market debut no sooner than 2025. According to its sources, geopolitical instability in the region could also influence the timing of any announcement. The war in Gaza and escalating tensions between Israel and Lebanon present new problems for the Gulf region.

        "content": "A year after  Jamie Dimon  named  geopolitics as the world's biggest risk ,  JPMorgan Chase 's CEO sounded the alarm again, warning that the state of global stability has gotten worse. During his visit to India, Dimon said in  an exclusive interview  with CNBC-TV18 released Tuesday, \"My caution is all geopolitics, which may determine the state of the economy.\" \"Geopolitics is getting worse, they are not getting better. There is chance for accidents in energy supply. God knows if other countries get involved. You have a lot of war taking place right now,\" he said, before referencing attacks conducted by Yemen's Houthi rebel group that have taken place in the Red Sea. According to the U.S. military,  the Houthis have attacked at least two crude oil tankers  this month. Geopolitical instability \"is my biggest caution,\" Dimon said. He also urged the U.S. to prepare for a prolonged war between Ukraine and Russia. The interview came almost a year after Dimon had called geopolitics, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest risk that he sees facing the world, larger than high inflation or a U.S. recession. Following a lengthy period of sticky inflation, the Federal Reserve last Wednesday made a jumbo rate cut, its first reduction since March 2020. Traders have piled on, driving the  S&P 500  to a fresh closing high on Monday. But Dimon expressed skepticism about the U.S. economy and what markets are pricing in. \"I'm a long-term optimist, but in the short run, I'm also more skeptical of other people that say everything [is] going to be great. Markets are pricing things like they're going to be great. Put me on the cautious side of that one,\" he said."

Market participants were also keeping an eye on shares of Commerzbank Tuesday after the stock fell around 5.7% during the previous session. Shares of Commerzbank provisionally ended 2.2% higher. UniCredit announced Monday it had increased its stake in the German lender to around 21% and submitted a request to boost that holding to up to 29.9%, signaling a takeover bid might be in the cards. Earlier this month, the Italian bank took a 9% stake in Commerzbank, confirming that half of this shareholding was acquired from the German government. U.S. stocks  pulled back from record levels on Tuesday after a  weaker-than-expected  consumer confidence reading. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index slid to 98.7 in September, down from 105.6 in August, the biggest one-month decline since August 2021. The Dow Jones consensus forecast was for a reading of 104. The gains were modest but appeared to be a continuation of last week's rally after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point. The fed funds rate now sits at a range of 4.75% to 5.00%"

        "content": "China bonds rallied with yields hitting record lows after the People's Bank of China on Tuesday announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks, and also reduce the reverse repo rate. Yield on China's 10-year government bonds fell 3.2 basis points to 2.041%, data from LSEG showed, marking a record low. 30-year bond yields dropped 0.4 basis points to a record low of 2.168%. \"Yields declined due to larger-than-expected PBOC easing. The 20bp cut to 7-day reverse repo rate is the largest since the Covid crisis. While commendable, it is no big bang rate cut,\" said Winson Phoon, Maybank's head of fixed income research. \"Growth outlook should receive a near-term boost to sentiment, but what really matters is a sustainable recovery in the medium term, which remains unclear,\" he added. PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng announced at a press conference that China will be reducing the reserve requirement ratio or the amount of cash banks must hold by 50 basis points. China's onshore yuan weakened to 7.06 against the dollar, according to data from LSEG. This sudden high-level press conference was arranged following last week's interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which initiated an easing cycle that may allow China's central bank to lower its rates further to stimulate growth amid deflationary pressures. In recent months, insurance companies and institutional investors have  flocked to China's bond market , partly due to limited investment opportunities available elsewhere. The real estate market has declined, and the stock market has had difficulty bouncing back from several years of low performance. China's central bank has  consistently cautioned  about the risks of destabilizing bubbles as investors flock to government bonds. In July, the PBOC-affiliated \"Financial News\" criticized the rush to  purchaseChinese government bonds, labeling the move as a form of \"shorting\" the economy . \"This is the only asset in China that is safe,\" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis told CNBC. \"The rest  credit, equity, are not safe. It is increasingly unsafe. So everybody's jumping on sovereign bonds.\" Investors with excess savings are piling into bonds because there's no access to foreign assets, she added. PBOC's Pan indicated that a 0.2-0.25% reduction in the loan prime rate was also on the table, though he did not clarify when this might happen or whether he was referring to the one-year or five-year LPR. Last Friday, the PBOC maintained its main benchmark lending rates at their current levels during the monthly fixing. \"The bond yields should go lower due to cut to the policy rate, i.e. 7-day reverse repo. In the meantime, deposit rates will be lowered which should favor bond markets as well,\" Hao Zhou, chief economist at Guotai Junan International told CNBC via email."

        "content": "LONDON  European stocks closed higher Monday as investors assessed banking deals and German and French business activity data. The pan-European  Stoxx 600 index  ended 0.4% higher, with most sectors and major bourses in positive territory. Autos stocks led the gains, up over 1.9% from the previous session. Shares of  Commerzbank  fell around 5.7% after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz criticized UniCredit's \"hostile\" and \"unfriendly\" move on the bank, Reuters reported. His comments come shortly after Italy's  UniCredit announced it had  increased its stake in the German lender to around 21% and submitted a request to boost the holding to up to 29.9%. \"UniCredit believes that there is substantial value that can be unlocked within Commerzbank, either stand-alone or within UniCredit, for the benefit of Germany and the bank's wider stakeholders. However, as was the case for UniCredit, such potential requires action for it to be crystalized,\" the bank said on Monday. The Stoxx 600 had traded lower earlier in the day after French preliminary composite PMI data,  a measure of business activity in the manufacturing and services sector, fell in September . It came in at 47.4, an eight-month low and down from 53.1 in August,  HCOB data showed . The data was far below a Reuters forecast of 50.6. A reading below 50 indicates contraction territory. German business activity also contracted in September, with the HCOB flash composite PMI falling from 48.4 in August to 47.2 in September, a seven-month low. \"A technical recession seems to be baked in\" to Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) outlook, according to Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank (HCOB). \"Our GDP nowcast for the current quarter, which considers the HCOB PMI among other indicators, now points to a 0.2% decrease compared to the quarter before. In the second quarter GDP already shrank at a rate of 0.1%. There is still some hope that the fourth quarter will be better as higher wages combined with lower inflation should boost not only real income but also consumption, supporting domestic demand.\" Retailer  Hugo Boss  erased earlier losses after analysts at Bank of America Global Research cut their rating on the stock to \"underperform\" from \"buy,\" citing waning Chinese demand denting the wider luxury sector. The  company itself warned of  challenging market environments in China and the U.K. as it cut its sales outlook in a July trading update. Shares of Hugo Boss closed 1.5% higher, having tumbled more than 6% earlier in the session. Elsewhere, shares of British property portal  Rightmove  traded 0.8% higher after the group reportedly rejected yet another sweetened takeover offer from Australian property listing firm REA Group. Global markets continue to trade higher following the Federal Reserve's 50-basis-point cut last week,its first cut in four years.  Asia-Pacific markets  were mostly higher overnight as investors also digested monetary policy decisions from Japan and China. U.S. stocks were  slightly higher  on Monday after excitement over last week's rate cut propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record closing level."

        "header": "India rules out joining world\u2019s largest trade deal, accuses China of 'very opaque' trade practices",
        "content": "India's commerce minister rejected the idea of joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest trade deal, maintaining that it is not in the country's interest to be part of a free trade agreement with China. \"India is not going to join the RCEP because neither did it reflect the guiding principles on which ASEAN was started, nor is it in the nation's interest to do a free trade agreement with China,\" India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal told CNBC's Tanvir Gill in an interview. The  RCEP deal  was  signed in 2020 by 15 Asia-Pacific countries   which makes up out 30% of global GDP  and came into force in January 2022. The countries are the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and five of their largest trading partners, China, South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Negotiations for the RCEP started in 2013  and initially included India, which some members viewed as a counterbalance to China. However, in 2019, India chose not to join RCEP, citing unresolved \"core interest\" issues. Back then,  India did not expand on what some of those core unresolved interests were . Goyal noted that at that time, India already had a free trade agreement with ASEAN, Japan and Korea, as well as a bilateral trade with New Zealand worth $300 million. \"It was not in our farmers' interest, RCEP did not reflect the aspirations of our small and micro medium industries and sector, and in some form, was nothing but a free trade agreement with China,\" he said. \"When you see from the lens sitting outside the country, you don't realize how difficult it is to compete against a non-transparent economy,\" the minister continued, in reference to China. \"Certainly nobody back home would like to have an FTA with [a] non-transparent economy, very opaque in its economic practices, where both trading systems, political systems, the economy  the way it is managed  is completely different from what the democratic world wants.\" Goyal also accused China of using the World Trade Organization's policies to its advantage, flooding various economies with goods at low prices which often do not meet quality standards. From solar panels to cars to steel, China has recently been churning out more goods in an economy that has been slow to absorb, resulting in a surge of cheap exports to foreign markets. The minister also made a strong case for India to become a Taiwan \"plus one\" semiconductor country. \"China Plus One\" is a phrase used to describe a supply chain strategy that sees companies diversifying manufacturing and sourcing, by continuing operations in the mainland while also expanding into other countries. This approach aims to reduce risks linked to complete reliance on a single country's market or supply chain. Spinning off that idea, Goyal thinks India can become an alternative place in the region for companies that want to diversify outside of Taiwan for semiconductors. \"We are encouraging [the] semiconductor industry in a big way. We started building up the ecosystem, which is essential before we can see more and more foundries coming into the country for the actual chip making,\" Goyal said. \"We expect the demand for semiconductor products to be about $100 billion by 2030, and will grow exponentially thereafter,\" he said, adding that interest in India's semiconductor industry is expanding \"by leaps and bounds.\" India aims to establish itself as a major chips hub  similar to the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea, actively seeking foreign companies to set up their operations in the country. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi  inaugurated three semiconductor plants , bringing the total count of plants under development in India to four. One of those plants is a joint venture between Tata Electronics and Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. The plant, which is set up in Dholera, Gujarat state, is  expected to deliver its first batch of semiconductors by late 2025 or early 2026 . Asked if India can be Taiwan's \"plus one\" in the semiconductor space, Goyal said that his country's size, democracy and rule of law means it is a \"safe habor.\" \"It provides an alternative where you will always have a youthful population in life, huge demand, and you will have the rule of law to back it. I think that's a very compulsive case,\" he said. The world recognizes that excessive concentration in any one region is fraught with serious risks, Goyal added. India's chip strategy  has two main components: attracting foreign companies to establish operations and invest in the country, as well as forming partnerships with other major semiconductor nations, such as the U.S. In 2021,  the government approved a $10 billion incentive program  for the sector, which is also available to foreign companies. As of 2024, Taiwan, the world's chipmaking powerhouse , is expected to hold around 44% of global market share , followed by China with 28% and South Korea with 12%, according to a report. The U.S. and Japan account for 6% and 2%, respectively. The authors of the report,  Taiwan consultancy Trendforce , said Taiwan's global capacity share in advanced manufacturing processes is expected to decrease to 40% by 2027, while South Korea's could see a 2% decline. In the same time period, China's is expected to increase by 3% to 31%."

The regional benchmark closed 1.4% higher Thursday, after the U.K.'s Bank of England and Norway's Norges Bank both held rates steady, drawing a contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve's bumper rate cut a day prior.

        "header": "How Fed rate cuts affect the global economy",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions can influence the trajectory of the U.S. economy. \"The U.S. economy's stature is one of the key drivers of the importance of the Fed,\" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. \"The [U.S.] economy remains one of the largest economies in the world, and certainly of late, one of the ones that's been fastest growing.\" At its September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to reduce the target range of its widely impactful federal funds rate. Changes to the Fed's interest rate can influence the cost of loan products such as mortgages and the value of  cash, bonds and stocks . The Fed's decision to unwind its most recent economic tightening cycle is expected to be felt around the world. By August 2024, annual inflation was 5.9% globally,  according to the International Monetary Fund . The group also reported that inflation was closer to 2.6% on average across advanced economies like the United States. The Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rate comes after months of shaky labor market data in the U.S. The unemployment rate stood at  4.2% in August 2024 with 7.1 million Americans without work , little changed from recent months. But the jobs picture had darkened notably from a year ago, when unemployment was 3.8%, with 6.3 million Americans looking for work. The central banks of advanced economies around the world hiked interest rates to ward off a global bout of inflation. Economists have noted that the simultaneous tightening of conditions across borders could amplify their effects. The European Central Bank also has reduced its policy rate  twice in 2024 .   Global GDP growth is expected to be 3.2% in 2024 and 3.3% in 2025 according to the  IMF .  \"The actions of the Federal Reserve Board they're not just limited to the U.S. They have an implication, a spillover effect in other parts of the world also,\" said Reena Aggarwal, director of Georgetown University's Psaros Center for financial markets and policy. Fed decisions can also impact foreign exchange markets given their effect on the value of U.S. dollars, the global reserve currency.  \"Emerging markets are impacted because a lot of their borrowing is in dollars. And so they've got to repay the interest and the principal in dollars. And if interest rates are changing in the U.S., all the cost of borrowing is changing,\" said Aggarwal in an interview with CNBC. Other countries have attempted to increase the profile of their currencies with mixed results. Most notably, the People's Bank of China has established its own international monetary system based on China's yuan, or renminbi. Economists at the Fed write that China's central bank has managed the value of the yuan to help the country achieve its goals on trade. China has also established its own network of swap lines to rival the systems offered by central banks like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. \"A lot of the [electric vehicles] that we see coming out of China is a direct result of the fact that China has become debt saturated and can't use its previous growth model to just increase investment,\" said Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard. \"If they're following this growth model, then they have to rely more on exports. At the same time, they want to internationalize the renminbi,\" Beamish told CNBC. The yuan accounted for 4.3% of payments made globally in 2023, according to  the Federal Reserve . The U.S. central bank notes that while that share is rising, it's far behind the use of dollars (47%) or euros (23%).

        "header": "Why EU tariffs are unlikely to dent Chinese EV makers' European expansion",
        "content": "Chinese electric vehicles will remain competitive in Europe despite the EU's additional tariffs on autos made in the country, particularly after they were revised lower last month. In the  latest tariff revisions  at end August, BYD, China's behemoth automaker, saw tariffs cut to 17% from 17.4%,  Geely  to 19.3% from 19.9%, and  SAIC  saw a reduction to 36.3% from 37.6%. To make the European market unattractive for Chinese EV exporters, tariffs have to be as high as 50%, according  to research group Rhodium . It said that number might need to be even higher for vertically integrated manufacturers such as BYD. The current tariffs will not be a significant deterrent to China's EV-makers, said Joseph McCabe, president and CEO of global auto research company AutoForecast Solutions. \"Tariffs on Chinese-made EVs will create a hurdle, but not a barrier to entry,\" he added. He pointed out that the EU's tariffs were not as severe as those announced by North America because European and Chinese original equipment manufacturers are heavily interconnected. The U.S. announced  a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs  in May this year. Canada  followed suit  last month. \"It is a delicate balance to promote domestic European production without severely impacting their Chinese operations,\" McCabe said. Chinese EV makers are coming up with newer, cheaper offerings even as the EU strives to curtail imports via tariffs. At a conference in May this year, Chinese behemoth  BYD   announced its Dolphin model  to the European market at less than $21,550. The model is a rebrand of the Chinese Seagull model. In comparison,  Western EV-maker Tesla's  Model 3, the brand's cheapest offering, is being sold for  $44,480 in the United Kingdom . Electric vehicles made by Tesla in China also face a 9% tariff on imports to the EU. Even with the 17% levy, BYD's Dolphin model will still be about $23,270 cheaper than the China-imported Tesla Model 3. To better compete with fierce Chinese rivals,  German brand Volkswagen has announced plans  to develop a low-cost electric vehicle for the European market at a comparable price of around $21,476 by 2027. \"Now, profitability takes a back seat to market share. The investment community rewards new, innovative EV players on the promise what they could be rather than short-term financial performance that legacy manufacturers are measured,\" said McCabe. \"If they really have to kill the EV industry in China, they have to put in 300% of tariffs ... which, you know, doesn't make sense from my perspective,\" William Ma, CIO of GROW Investment Group told CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia \" on Tuesday. If the Chinese original equipment manufacturing sector is affected, the risk of retaliatory tariff measures from China against Europe is high, McCabe warned. EU tariff talks started  in June as a response to \"unfair subsidies\" to Chinese EV makers,  which pose \"a threat of economic injury\" to European EV counterparts. \"This geopolitical or sanction will not go away easily for the next year or two,\" Ma said."

The pan-European  Stoxx 600 index  provisionally ended the session 1.36% higher. All major bourses and most sectors traded in the green, with mining stocks adding 3.16%. Utilities were a rare outlier, down 1.76%. Bank of England policy makers voted to hold its key rate steady at 5% in a widely anticipated move. The U.K. central bank said a gradual approach to monetary easing remained appropriate, with services inflation remaining elevated. Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said the decision likely paves the way for the Bank to cut rates at its next meeting in November. While today may be a pause, the general consensus is to expect more rate cuts this year and into next as the economic momentum that had built up slows and inflation remains close to target, James said. Two more cuts are expected by financial markets, and with time running out in 2024, the next meeting is likely to see the BoEs next cut delivered, she added. The decision came a day after the Fed announced a jumbo 50 basis point cut to interest rates, bringing its target range to 4.75% to 5.00%. U.S. stocks  rallied in morning deals as investors  digested the decision . Trading in  Asia-Pacific  was choppy Thursday following the Fed cut, but stocks ultimately rose during through the session. Back in Europe, retail stocks climbed 1.9%. British retailer  Next  jumped as much as 5.8% during morning trade before pulling back to just above the flatline.

        "header": "CNBC's Inside India newsletter: Will India's lofty manufacturing ambitions bear fruit?",
        "content": "This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. India has long been thought of as the  world's back-office , while its Asian counterpart China claimed the title of global factory powerhouse. Those classifications held true for decades as India grew its capabilities in global command centers and other information technology services while China dominated large-scale manufacturing. India's economic focus shifted to a new target when its government declared that  manufacturing would spur  its economy to high-income status by 2047. The central government's launch of the \"Make in India\" initiative in September 2014 kicked off a move to galvanize efforts in becoming a manufacturing hub. Its intent was clear: to develop India's manufacturing   capabilities in sectors like automotives, electronics, pharmaceuticals and aerospace while creating opportunities for locals. In the 10 years since the launch of  \" Make in India, \"  the government has dished out varied support measures such as the Production Linked Incentive Scheme, which supports businesses both local and foreign in planting roots in India. With an outlay of 1.97 trillion Indian rupees ($24 billion),  14 sectors are being leveraged under the PLI  based on factors like their scope to reduce imports, boost exports and create employment. From tech hub to iPhone manufacturer To witness India's progress from a tech hub to a manufacturer, one merely needs to journey north from its own version of Silicon Valley in Bengaluru. Approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) northeast in the district of Kolar lies a Tata Group-owned facility that manufactures iPhones for tech giant  Apple . The Tata Group became the first Indian company to manufacture iPhones after acquiring Taiwanese firm  Wistron 's operations last October. Another iPhone facility will soon be 45 kilometers away from Bengaluru in Doddaballapura. Run by Foxconn, around 20 million iPhones are expected to be produced here annually, once it commences operations. With  14% of iPhones being made in India , the nation is now the largest producer of the smartphone after China,  according to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Apple has plans to raise this to 24% to 25% between 2027 and 2028. Foxconn is among a growing number of contract manufacturers setting up shop in India to capitalize on its reservoir of workers seeking employment. The firm now has over 30 factories in India employing some 40,000 workers. Like the Tata Group, other Indian firms have also jumped on the bandwagon. For instance,  Dixon Technologies  is among India's largest electronics manufacturers and has progressed from making gadgets like home appliances and surveillance systems for domestic consumption to producing smartphones for export. Apart from electronics, India also has a foothold in pharmaceuticals and automotive manufacturing thanks in part to the \"ChinaPlusOne\" strategy that has nudged companies to diversify their supply chains and operations. For instance, automaker Kia India set up its manufacturing facility in the district of Anantapur  over 200 kilometers away from Bengaluru  while homegrown company  Divi's Laboratories  is among the largest manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and counts global titans Novartis , GSK and Merck among its clients. India's manufacturing sector has seen \"remarkable\" growth says, Samir Kapadia, founder and CEO of B2B marketplace India Index. For instance, it has benefitted from infrastructure developments like a six-fold increase in the pace of highway construction and a 40% jump in the average speed of freight trains over the past two decades, he said. \"These infrastructural shifts in India have improved connectivity within and outside the country putting India at a very different playing field than it was 10 years ago when 'Make in India' started,\" Kapadia told CNBC's Inside India. He foresees further growth based on the $1.3 trillion earmarked by the government for infrastructure development for 25 years from 2021 to 2046, along with the partnerships and efforts that corporates are making. But what excites him more is the \"incremental arbitrage India will have as it takes market share from China inch by inch, sector by sector,\" added Kapadia. For context, 61% of the 500 executive-level U.S. managers surveyed by market research firm OnePoll earlier this year said they would  pick India over China if both countries could manufacture the same materials , while 56% preferred India to serve their supply chain needs within the next five years. \"What India will do is a lot more grandiose  I see a leapfrog in its entire workforce into industries like semiconductors, advanced manufacturing, aerospace and medical devices,\" Kapadia said. India vs. other emerging markets While India looks to poach China's manufacturing share, other countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Mexico are also stiff competitors. Indonesia's manufacturing capabilities include nickel and battery materials, while Vietnam's comparative advantage lies in broadcast equipment and machinery, to name a few. Bangladesh has a strong share in textiles manufacturing while Mexico, which produces autos, aviation and aerospace equipment, has an edge over India given its proximity to the U.S. Franklin Templeton's Yi Ping Liao, however, does not see major cause for concern. \"I think there's always going to be competition but each country will have its own niche,\" the assistant portfolio manager, who is part of the emerging markets equity Asia strategy team, told CNBC's Inside India. What sets India apart is its lower cost of labor relative to the other markets, and the fact that capacity built there can address not just exports, but also its large domestic market which has huge consumption potential, Liao said. \"There are still a lot of challenges for India, but they're coming from a low base. So even if it grows its electronics manufacturing from 3% to 9%  that's a three-fold increase which is a good opportunity,\" she noted. What's lacking? Even as India embraces the maturation of its manufacturing industry, the sector still has a long runway before it can help the country realize its vision of becoming a developed nation. \"The policy intention and direction of Make in India is correct. But we haven't seen much of a change in terms of increasing the share of manufacturing in India's GDP, or in job creation,\" Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at TS Lombard, told Inside India. In fact, the share of manufacturing in India's GDP dipped from around 18% in 2012 to  14% in the  current fiscal year, recent data shows.  Indian investment firm DSP Mutual Fund  predicts that the sector's share in overall GDP will rise to 21% by 2034. What is needed is an increase in India's competitiveness through the addition of jobs at higher skill levels, Deveshwar said. For starters, this can be cultivated through vocational training for unskilled workers in areas like textile manufacturing which can \"be a big provider of jobs,\" she said. More experienced employees can take on jobs in semiconductors and high value-added products \"which require targeted skills,\" she noted. India is also in need of foreign investments, which is at a five-year low, said Deveshwar. Foreign direct investments into India as a share of GDP have lagged behind Brazil and China between 2010 and 2022, which the TS Lombard economist finds concerning, given its strong macroeconomic indicators. \"We haven't really seen investment generation via FDI let alone in manufacturing. FDI flows are very much skewed towards services and the IT sector where India has had a historical advantage,\" she said. \"We have one or two big names coming in and making headlines but we're not seeing a large scale momentum pick up. I think that boils down to the structural fault lines like the need for better infrastructure which takes time to ramp up.\" What is sure, though, is that India's manufacturing spurt should not be compared to China, Deveshwar said. \"Our ecosystems are very different. And so, India's manufacturing sector will grow and evolve at a pace different from China.\" India can achieve economic growth of up to 8%, RBI governor says.

India's central bank chief plays down fears of a deposit crunch.

        "header": "Ray Dalio names the top five forces shaping the global economy",
        "content": "SINGAPORE  U.S. billionaire  Ray Dalio  named the top five forces at the front and center of the world's economy. Speaking at the Milken Institute's Asia Summit in Singapore, the founder of Bridgewater Associates said the five factors are interrelated and often cyclical. Dalio made his remarks Wednesday ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. With uncertainty still circling around what the Fed will do at its meeting this week, Dalio raised concerns about how the country's debt will be managed. \"We're going to have a Fed interest rate change, and [what will] that whole dynamic do? What happens to all the debt? How will that be dealt with?\" he mused. The U.S. central bank has kept benchmark rates at their highest level in 23 years, leading the government to  allocate $1.049 trillion for debt service   an increase of 30% compared with a year ago. This is part of an anticipated total of $1.158 trillion in payments for the entire year. \"What is the value of it and as one man's debts or another man's assets? How is it as a storehold of wealth? These are important questions that are pressing questions,\" he threw the question out to attendees. \"The second is the issue of internal order and disorder,\" Dalio said, referring to U.S. politics ahead of the election. \"There are irreconcilable differences between the right and the left, prompted by large wealth and value gaps... and they call into question even the orderly transition of power,\" he added. For the first time in the 2024 election cycle, Vice President Kamala Harris is  now considered more likely to win  than former President Donald Trump, a CNBC Fed Survey released Tuesday showed. Last week, the candidates debated issues from abortion rights to tariffs and other policy proposals. Still, no matter who occupies the White House, the president's policy agenda has limited impact on the overall health of the U.S. economy. Dalio cited geopolitics as his third concern: namely, the relationship between the U.S. and China. The U.S.-China relationship has been defined by a range of ongoing tensions, such as territorial issues in the South China Sea, Taiwan's political status and economic tariffs. \"I think probably, there's a fear of war that will stand in the way  mutually assured destruction. But it's disorder,\" he emphasized later, without naming a specific ignition point. Dalio then said \"acts of nature\" have historically posed a bigger threat to humanity and society than war. \"Acts of nature, droughts, floods and pandemics have killed more people and been responsible for more domestic orders and international orders changing,\" Dalio noted. And the cost of climate change is about to increase, he emphasized.  According to the World Economic Forum , the climate crisis results in a 12% loss in global GDP for each 1C increase in temperature. Technology is going to \"be fantastic\" if one is able to adopt and invest in it appropriately, the billionaire said. \"The potential productivity benefits of that are enormous,\" he said, elaborating that technology produces unicorn companies, and when it does  a sliver of the population fares better. \"Whoever wins the technology war is going to win the military war,\" he further said. As he assessed the five factors on a whole, Dalio concluded that the \"surprises are more on the downside than the upside,\" he said."

        "header": "China's ultra-rich population sees 'dramatic' growth in last 10 years, outpacing the U.S., report shows",
        "content": "The world's super rich club expanded significantly over the past 10 years, with China leading the charge, according to the latest report from New World Wealth and investment migration advisor Henley & Partners. The number of centimillionaires surged 54% worldwide over the past decade to 29,350, particularly in China and the U.S., according to the report. Centimillionaires are ultra-high-net-worth individuals with  investable wealth of $100 million or more . \"America and China have experienced what can only be described as a centi-millionaire boom, significantly outperforming their European counterparts,\" said Juerg Steffen, chief executive officer of Henley & Partners. \"China's ascent has been the most dramatic, with its centi-millionaire population expanding by 108% over the past 10 years  outpacing even the stellar performance of the U.S., whose super-wealthy ranks swelled by 81% over the same period,\" the report observed. China's growth was driven in large part by the emergence of tech centimillionaires and industrial titans, Steffen said. There are currently 2,350 centimillionaires living in China. But the country's economy has stalled in recent years, dragged down by an embattled property sector, sticky unemployment and weak domestic consumption. Most of China's centimillionaire boom happened between 2013 to 2020, Andrew Amoils, wealth analyst at New World Wealth, told CNBC. Since 2020, the number of ultra-rich has only risen about 10%, he added. However, Henley & Partners maintained that cities like Hangzhou and Shenzhen still demonstrate potential as emerging tech hubs and were listed among cities \"poised for exceptional growth of over 150%\" in their centimillionaire populations by 2040. Economic expansion in these two cities has outpaced that of the  country's 5% growth .  Hangzhou's GDP grew 6.9% year-on-year  for the first half of 2024. Similarly,  Shenzhen grew 5.9% year-on-year  across the same period, lifted by its industrial sector. Between now and 2040, Amoils still expects robust centimillionaire population growth in China of between 80% to 100%. Both the U.S. and China are expected to outperform the global average centimillionaire-growth rate of around 75% by 2040. The report also noted that a number of Asian and Middle Eastern cities are positioned for 150% growth in their ultra rich populations, including Taipei, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and India's Bengaluru. Conversely, more established hubs like Zurich, Chicago, Moscow and Madrid are expected to see sluggish super wealth growth of less than 50% in the years through 2040. Additionally, Steffen attributed Europe's sluggish performance to the slow expansion of key markets like Germany, France and the U.K. That said, while larger European markets lag, smaller ones such as Monaco, Malta, Montenegro and Poland have experienced significant growth in their centimillionaire populations, increasing by 75% or more. The U.S. remains a top wealth hub, with cities like New York, Los Angelesand the San Francisco Bay Area expected to see further growth of over 50% in their ultra-wealthy populations. However, America's continued dominance could depend on who wins the upcoming elections. \"Existing centi-millionaire growth and migration trends will depend largely on the upcoming U.S. presidential elections where we anticipate drastic differences in fiscal, monetary, economic, and social policies,\" said David Young, president of the Committee for Economic Development at think tank The Conference Board. There has been a surge in affluent Americans considering alternative residence and citizenship options, Henley and Partners' research showed."

U.S. stocks  were higher in morning deals, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high. Policymakers at the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan also meet on Thursday and Friday, respectively. Asia Pacific markets  were mixed on Tuesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 dropping over 2% as the yen strengthened ahead of the Fed decision.

        "header": "It's a big week for central banks around the world, with a slew of rate moves on the table",
        "content": "A flurry of major central banks will hold monetary policy meetings this week, with investors bracing for interest rate moves in either direction. The Federal Reserve's highly anticipated two-day meeting, which gets underway Tuesday, is poised to take center stage. The U.S. central bank is  widely expected  to join others around the world in starting its own rate-cutting cycle. The only remaining question appears to be by how much the Fed will reduce rates. Traders currently see a quarter-point cut as the most likely outcome, although as many as 41% anticipate a half-point move, according to the  CME's FedWatch tool . Elsewhere, Brazil's central bank is  scheduled  to hold its next policy meeting across Tuesday and Wednesday. The Bank of England, Norway's Norges Bank and South Africa's Reserve Bank will all follow on Thursday. A busy week of central bank meetings will be rounded off when the Bank of Japan delivers its latest rate decision at the conclusion of its two-day meeting Friday. \"We're entering a cutting phase,\" John Bilton, global head of multi-asset strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC's \" Squawk Box Europe \" on Thursday. Speaking ahead of the European Central Bank's  most recent quarter-point rate cut , Bilton said the Fed was also set to lower interest rates by 25 basis points this week, with the Bank of England \"likely getting in on the party\" after the U.K. economy stagnated for a second consecutive month in July. \"We have all the ingredients for the beginning of a fairly extended cutting cycle but one that is probably not associated with a recession  and that's an unusual setup,\" Bilton said. \"It means that we get a lot of volatility to my mind in terms of price discovery around those who believe that actually the Fed [is] late, the ECB [is] late, this is a recession and those, like me, that believe that we don't have the imbalances in the economy, and this will actually spur further upside.\" Policymakers at the Fed have laid the groundwork for interest rate cuts in recent weeks. Currently, the Fed's target rate is sitting at 5.25% to 5.5%. Some economists have argued the U.S. central bank should deliver a 50 basis point rate cut in September, accusing it of having previously gone \" too far, too fast \" with monetary policy tightening. Others have described such a move as one that would be \" very dangerous \" for markets, pushing instead for the Fed to deliver a 25 basis point rate cut. \"We are more likely 25 but [would] love to see 50,\" David Volpe, deputy chief investment officer at Emerald Asset Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday. \"And the reason you do 50 next week would be as more or less a safety mechanism. You have seven weeks between next week and  the November meeting, and a lot can happen negatively,\" Volpe said. \"So, it would be more of a method of trying to get in front of things. The Fed is caught on their heels a little bit, so we think that it would be good if they got in front of it, did the 50 now, and then made a decision in terms of November and December. Maybe they do 25 at that point in time,\" he added. For Brazil's central bank, which has cut interest rates several times since July last year, stronger-than-anticipated second-quarter economic data is  seen as likely  to lead to an interest rate hike in September. \"We expect Banco Central to hike the Selic rate by 25bps next week (to 10.75%) and bring it to 11.50% by end-2024,\" Wilson Ferrarezi, an economist at TS Lombard, said in a research note published Wednesday. \"Further rate hikes into 2025 cannot be ruled out and will depend on the strength of domestic activity in Q4/24,\" he added. In the U.K., an interest rate cut from the Bank of England on Thursday is thought to be unlikely. A Reuters poll,  published Friday , found that all 65 economists surveyed expected the BOE to hold rates steady at 5%. The U.K. central bank  delivered  its first interest rate reduction in more than four years at the start of August. \"We have quarterly cuts from here. We don't think they are going to move next week, with a 7-2 vote,\" Ruben Segura Cayuela, head of European economics at Bank of America, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday. He added that the next BOE rate cut is likely to take place in November. South Africa's Reserve Bank is expected to cut interest rates on Thursday, according to economists  surveyed by Reuters . The move would mark the first time it has done so since the central bank's response to the coronavirus pandemic four years ago. Norges Bank is poised to hold its next meeting on Thursday. The Norwegian central bank kept its interest rate unchanged at a 16-year high of 4.5% in mid-August and  said  at the time that the policy rate \"will likely be kept at that level for some time ahead.\" The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, is not expected to raise interest rates at the end of the week, although a majority of economists  polled by Reuters  expect an increase by year-end."

        "header": "China raising its retirement age may be unpopular but it's much needed, analysts say",
        "content": "China's top legislative body passed an official plan Friday to begin incrementally raising the nation's statutory retirement age from Jan. 1 of next year and concluding in 2040, according to  Chinese state media . The final goal of the 15-year plan is to raise the retirement age by three years for men to 63 years old, five years for women who work in factories from 50 to 55 and three years for women who work in white-collar jobs from 55 to 58. The reforms are \"overdue and very much welcome,\" Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank Investment Banking Group, told CNBC. China has been grappling with a shrinking workforce and looming pension budget shortfalls that could significantly damage the economy. Economists have long called for an overhaul of the nation's retirement age laws, currently among the world's lowest, which was set in an era of lower life expectancies. In 2023, the average life expectancy increased to  78.6 years,  from roughly  44 years  in 1960. Beijing's low birth rates and relatively young age of retirement means its working-age population will continue to shrink. The country needs to be able to tap into its pool of older workers when workforce contraction becomes more acute in the next decade, Tay said. \"This policy change will forestall a sharper drop in China's potential growth, if only marginally.\" It is a prudent move that \"strikes a balance between fixing the demographic stagnation and managing people's expectations\" in a gradual and measured pace, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL, an investment management firm. Beijing had previously said it was mulling the plan of raising retirement ages but backed away after spurring public outrage. \"The plan might be unpopular but provides much-needed certainty and is good for China's long-term economic future,\" Tianchen Xu, senior economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC. He noted that China has avoided narrowing the five-year gap between men and women. China is treading cautiously to \"avoid more social backlash,\" Xu said. Before the announcement, economists said China's pension system, which relies on a shrinking active workforce to pay for a growing number of retirees, is unsustainable and needs to be reformed. Raising the retirement age would help ease local governments' pension pool cash crunch, Sheana Yue, an economist at Oxford Economics, said. \"Although inflows might not change much, outflows will be delayed, buying local government time to fix their budget deficit.\" In  a 2019 report , the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimated that the pension system would be out of money by 2035. Still, \"more needs to be done to improve retirement adequacy,\" Maybank's Tay said, while stating that China needs a stronger pension plan and diversified investment avenues to ensure sustainable retirement savings. This 15-year plan will be implemented gradually based on a rather complicated calculating system. China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has added a few tools for citizens to check their indicated retirement age on its website and mobile app. Beijing said in the statement that exemptions may be granted to certain people, while also urging local and regional governments to \"react actively to the ageing population, encourage and support people to join workforce or start businesses,\" according to CNBC's translation of Mandarin. China may roll out \"another round of delay in the late 2030s, especially if China's pension fund balance is tight,\" Xu cautioned. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect Tianchen Xu's quote accurately."

        "header": "CNBC's Inside India newsletter: What happens when the Fed cuts rates?",
        "content": "This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. The Federal Reserve is almost certain tostart its rate-cutting cycle next week. Historically, a rate cut has been a signal for central banks in emerging markets, like India, to follow by easing monetary policy in their regions. However, this time, it's likely to be different. When will India cut rates? The latest data shows that the inflation rate appears to be heading in the wrong direction in India. The headline inflation rate rose in August to 3.65% compared to 3.6% in the previous month. Food prices, which constitute a large proportion of overall inflation, appeared to be one of the big drivers. Is it a cause for alarm? Not really, since the latest figures are still below the Indian central bank's target of 4%. Instead, markets have simply hit snooze on a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India for the moment. \"The slight rise in India's headline CPI inflation in August reinforces our view that the Reserve Bank will proceed with a bit of caution and keep rates unchanged in its next meeting in October,\" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, told clients. \"But it won't wait until any later than December to begin loosening policy.\" But as Inside India covered last week, India's GDP slowed to 6.7% in the second calendar quarter  compared to last year's 8.2%, piling pressure on the central bank to take its foot off the brakes sooner rather than later. A rate cut by the Fed is also widely expected to provide more immediate relief to the Indian rupee, which fell to an all-time low against the greenback last week. Cutting ahead of the Federal Reserve or alongside it, would have risked pushing the rupee lower, further adding to inflationary pressures. \"Interest rates across the world have seen a sharp jump and a cycle reversal seems likely in the coming quarters which would create headroom for the RBI to also taper down benchmark interest rates in India,\" said Mahesh Nandurkar, head of India research at Jefferies, in a note to clients. Bank of America also sees rate cuts beginning in December 2024, with interest rates in India lower by an entire percentage point by the end of next year. How will stocks react? If there's no global recession, a risk-on sentiment will likely help push up emerging market equities in the medium term after the U.S. central bank cuts rates. However, the path stocks take is unlikely to be in a straight line. \"According to our colleagues, global equities typically fare well around rate cuts and are on average higher 12 [months] after the start of the easing cycles unless there is significant recessions/crises,\" said Surendra Goyal, head of India research at Citi, in a note to clients. However, the premier benchmark index of the Indian stock exchange, Nifty 50, is likely to be the one exception to the rule, according to Bank of America. \"While the Fed cuts rates, that could possibly lead to RBI cutting rates as well, and that is negative for earnings in the banking sector, which is a large weight in the index which we have,\" Amish Shah, BofA's Head of India Research told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday. Bank profits are typically cyclical and depend on the interest rate levels. A fall in base rates will likely squeeze margins at most banks, prompting BofA to be \"cautious\" about the Nifty 50's prospects over the near term. Banks have the largest weight in the index and make up nearly a fifth of the 50 stocks. \"Our view is that large cap stocks aren't very expensive and therefore, markets could probably go sideways for some time,\" Shah added. Workers at Samsung Electronics' India factory go on strike.  On Monday,  hundreds of workers stopped working , demanding higher wages and better working hours. The Sriperumbudurplant, which is located near Chennai, mainly produces refrigerators and washing machines. A Samsung India spokesperson told Reuters the company will \"address any grievances [workers] may have.\" Gautam Adani a possible trillionaire?  Tesla CEO Elon Musk will likely be the first trillionaire,  according to a report from Informa Connect Academy . The second to reach that status, according to the report, will be India's Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani Group conglomerate. A UAE bank might take a major stake in an Indian lender.  The investment is expected to be  worth billions of dollars , UAE's ambassador to India, Abdulnasser Alshaali, told CNBC TV18. It is a reflection of the deepening trade and cultural relationship between the UAE and India, said Alshaali. \"We are the second largest export destination for India, the third largest trade partner, and the fourth largest investor,\" he noted. He did not disclose the names of the banks involved. India's rural demand will outpace urban consumption in the near term.  That's according to Upasana Chachra, chief India economist at Morgan Stanley. Chachra notes that sales of fast-moving consumer goods are rising in rural areas. Better weather this year and softer inflation in India mean that  the purchasing power of rural inhabitants is higher  this year than the last. The bank revised its forecast for India's 2025 GDP to 7% from 6.8% on the back of positive economic data. 'Well-run' Indian companies.

        "content": "LONDON  European stocks rose Thursday as investors in the region digested the European Central Bank's move to further ease monetary policy. The pan-European Stoxx 600  provisionally closed 0.78% higher. All major regional bourses ended the day in the green, with Germany's DAX closing 0.97% higher. Sectors were also mostly in positive territory as tech and mining stocks jumped 2% and 2.38% respectively. The European Central Bank  (ECB)slashed rates again by 25 basis points on Thursday, marking its second reduction to the deposit rate this year, but said it was not \"pre-committing\" to a future path for rates. The ECB's key interest rate  which helps to price all sorts of loans and mortgages across the bloc  is now at 3.5% after years of aggressive hikes. The ECB's meeting comes just days ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Sept. 17-18 meeting, at which it's expected to begin its own rate-cutting cycle. In markets, shares of Swiss pharmaceuticals firm  Roche  fell as much as 4.5% after it said Wednesday that positive results  released in July  from an early-stage trial of its experimental weight-loss pillwere based on just six patients. Shares closed 2.16% lower. Novo Nordisk  shares recorded their best day in a month LSEG data showed, climbing 3.08% before paring gains slightly and finishing the day 2.66% higher. Shares were boosted by news that its experimental anti-obesity pillcould be more effective than its existing Wegovy injection. European investors are also digesting the latest consumer price index report from the U.S. that reflected a 0.2% increase in consumer prices in August , putting the annual inflation rate at 2.5%  its lowest level since February 2021. Month-over-month core CPI  which does not include volatile food and energy prices  came out slightly hotter than expected, however. The S&P 500  was last higher  on Thursday after a choppy day for U.S. stocks on Wednesday. The latest producer price index, which tracks wholesale inflation data, reflected a 0.2% rise in August on a monthly basis. The reading was in line with expectations. There are no other major earnings or data releases in Europe on Thursday."

        "header": "Investors expecting an aggressive Fed cut are getting too 'ahead of the curve,' UBS CEO says",
        "content": "The CEO of Swiss banking giant UBS said Thursday that the fight against inflation isn't over yet, and some investors seem to be getting too ahead of themselves in expecting that the U.S. Federal Reserve could pull an aggressive rate cut this month. \"I think the market seems to be a little bit too ahead of the curve in expecting the Fed to go so aggressively,\" Sergio Ermotti, Group CEO of UBS Group AG, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\" The  question of whether the Fed will lower rates  at the end of its next policy meeting September 18 has largely been answered. The only question that remains is: by how much. The \"most important\" issue that the Fed needs consider is still inflation, which remains sticky and not yet \"totally under control,\" Ermotti added. Data released Wednesday showed that the  core U.S. consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.3% for the month  of August, slightly higher than forecasts of a 0.2% climb. While the wider CPI, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, rose 0.2% for the month of August, the uptick in core CPI may undercut the chances of an outsized interest rate cut by the Fed when policymakers meet next week. \"I would say probably a cut, but not as the market expects,\" Ermotti said. While traders are pricing in around an 85% chance of a 25 bps rate reduction in September, 15% are still pricing in a 50 bps lowering, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool . A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Fed's benchmark borrowing rate, which influences a bulk of other rates that consumers pay, is currently at 5.25%-5.50%. A long-awaited soft landing could still be managed, Ermotti said, adding that other economic data still appear to point to such a scenario. \"There is a lot of stickiness in part of the inflation, but consumers are holding up pretty well,\" he said.\"But I would say for the time being, the outlook is pretty consistent with a soft landing, and so we remain somehow positive on the situation.\" Ermotti also shared his optimism on Asia, saying while UBS sees \"very good momentum\" in the region's growth, the region is not immune from challenges posed by geopolitics and the wider global economic outlook. Despite China's gloomy economic outlook, Ermotti doubled down on the bank's commitments in the country and the opportunities it offers. \"We have been in China for more than 50 years, and we're going to be there for the next hundred, 200 years,\" he said. Last month,  UBS  shattered profit expectations for the second quarter, reporting  $1.136 billion  in net profit attributable to shareholders, amid cost-cutting measures as well as increasing revenue from its global wealth management and investment banking units. The company-compiled consensus forecast was $528 million. \"The two real opportunities and engine of growth for us are still the U.S. and Asia, broadly speaking, and China is a major driver of that,\" Ermotti said."

        "content": "British financial technology firm Revolut on Thursday criticized Facebook parent company Meta over its approach to tackling fraud, saying the U.S. tech giant should directly compensate people who fall victim to scams via its social media platforms. A day after  Meta  announced a partnership with U.K. banks  NatWest  and Metro Bank on a data-sharing framework designed to help prevent customers from falling prey to fraud schemes, Revolut said the pact \"falls woefully short of what's required to tackle fraud globally.\" In a statement, Woody Malouf, Revolut's head of financial crime, said that Meta's plans to tackle financial fraud on its platforms amount to \"baby steps, when what the industry really needs is giant leaps forward.\" \"These platforms share no responsibility in reimbursing victims, and so they have no incentive to do anything about it. A commitment to data sharing, albeit needed, simply isn't good enough,\" Malouf added. A Meta spokesperson told CNBC that its intelligence-sharing framework for banks \"is designed to enable banks to share information so we can work together to protect people using our respective services.\" \"Fraud is a multi-sector spanning issue that can only be addressed by working collaboratively,\" the spokesperson said via email. \"We encourage banks including Revolut to join in this effort.\" New payment industry reforms will come into force in the U.K. on Oct. 7 that require banks and payment firms to issue victims of so-called authorized push payment (APP) fraud a maximum compensation of 85,000 ($111,000). Britain's Payments System Regulator had previously recommended a 415,000 maximum compensation amount for fraud victims, but backed down following backlash from banks and payment firms. Revolut's Malouf said that, while his company is on board with steps the U.K. government is taking to combat fraud, Meta and other social media platforms should do their part to financially compensate those who fall victim to fraud as a result of scams originating on their sites. The fintech firm  published a report Thursday  alleging that 62% of user-reported fraud on its online banking platform originated from Meta, down from 64% last year. Facebook was the most common source of all scams reported by Revolut users, accounting for 39% of fraud, while WhatsApp was the second-highest source of such events with an 18% share, the bank said in its \"Consumer Security and Financial Crime Report . \""

        "content": "U.K. financial regulators hit British digital lender Starling Bank with a 29 million ($38.5 million) fine over failings related to its financial crime prevention systems. In a statement on Wednesday, London's Financial Conduct Authority said it had fined Starling \"for financial crime failings related to its financial sanctions screening.\" Starling also repeatedly breached a requirement not to open accounts for high-risk customers, the FCA said. \"Starling's financial sanction screening controls were shockingly lax,\" Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said in a statement Wednesday. \"It left the financial system wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions.\" In response to the FCA penalty, Starling said it was sorry for the failings outlined by the regulator and that it had completed detailed screening and an in-depth back book review of customer accounts. \"I would like to apologise for the failings outlined by the FCA and to provide reassurance that we have invested heavily to put things right, including strengthening our board governance and capabilities,\"David Sproul,chairmanof Starling Bank,said in a statement Wednesday. \"We want to assure our customers and employees that these are historic issues. We have learned the lessons of this investigation and are confident that these changes and the strength of our franchise put us in a strong position to continue executing our strategy of safe, sustainable growth, supported by a robust risk management and control framework,\" he added. Starling, one of the U.K.'s most popular online-only challenger banks, has been widely viewed as a potential IPO candidate in the coming year or so. The startup previously signaled plans to go public, but has moved back its expected timing from an earlier  targeted an IPO as early as 2023 . The FCA said in a statement that, as Starling expanded from 43,000 customers in 2017 to 3.6 million in 2023, the bank's measures to tackle financial crimes failed to keep pace with that growth. The FCA began looking into financial crime controls at digital challenger banks in 2021, concerned that fintech brands' anti-money laundering and know-your-customer compliance systems weren't robust enough to prevent fraud, money laundering and sanctions evasion on their platforms. After this probe was first opened, Starling agreed to stop opening new bank accounts for high-risk customers until it improved its internal controls. However, the FCA says that Starling failed to comply with this provision and opened over 54,000 accounts for 49,000 high-risk customers between September 2021 and November 2023. In January 2023, Starling became aware that, since 2017, its automated system was only screening clients against a fraction of the full list of individuals and entities subject to financial sanctions, the FCA said, adding that the bank identified systemic issues in its sanctions framework in an internal review. Since then, Starling has reported multiple potential breaches of financial sanctions to relevant authorities, according to the British regulator. The FCA said that Starling has already established programs to remediate the breaches it identified and to enhance its wider financial crime control framework. The British regulator added that its investigation into Starling completed in 14 months from opening, compared to an average of 42 months for cases closed in the calendar year 2023/24."

The government vow to provide strong stimulus induced newfound optimism in Chinese stocks that were beaten down amid a sluggish economy as well as regulatory crackdowns the past few years. David Tepper, founder of hedge fund Appaloosa Management,  told CNBC last week  that he's buying \"everything\" related to China because of the government support.

        "header": "Klarna CEO says a European tech brain drain is \u2018number one risk\u2019 for company ahead of IPO",
        "content": "A European technology talent brain drain is the biggest risk factor facing Klarna as the Swedish payments company gets closer to its upcoming initial public offering, according to CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski. In a wide-ranging interview with CNBC this week, Siemiatkowski said that unfavorable rules in Europe on employee stock options a common form of equity compensation tech firms offer to their staff could lead to Klarna losing talent to technology giants in the U.S. such as  Google ,  Apple  and  Meta . As Klarna which is known for its popular buy now, pay later installment plans prepares for its IPO, the lack of attractiveness of Europe as a place for the best and brightest to work has become a much more prominent fear, Siemiatkowski told CNBC. \"When we looked at the risks of the IPO, which is a number one risk in my opinion? Our compensation,\" said Siemiatkowski, who is approaching his 20th year as CEO of the financial technology firm. He was referring to company risk factors, which are a  common element of IPO prospectus filings . Compared to a basket of its publicly-listed peers, Klarna offers only a fifth of its equity as a share of its revenue, according to a study obtained by CNBC which the company paid consulting firm Compensia to produce. However, the study also showed that Klarna's publicly-listed peers offer six times the amount of equity that it does. Siemiatkowski said there a number of hurdles blocking Klarna and its European tech peers from offering employees in the region more favorable employee stock option plans, including costs that erode the value of shares they are granted when they join. In the U.K. and Sweden, he explained that employee social security payments deducted from their stock rewards are \"uncapped,\" meaning that staff at companies in these countries stand to lose more than people at firms in, say, Germany and Italy where there are concrete caps in place. The higher a firm's stock price, the more it must pay toward employees' social benefits, making it difficult for companies to plan expenses effectively. Britain and Sweden also calculate social benefits on the actual value of employees' equity upon sale in liquidity events like an IPO. \"It's not that companies are not willing to pay that,\" Siemiatkowski said. \"The biggest issue is the lack of predictability. If a staff cost is entirely associated with my stock price, and that has implications on my PNL [profit and loss] ... it has cost implications for the company. It makes it impossible to plan.\" In the past year, Siemiatkowski has more clearly signalled Klarna's ambitions to go public soon. In an interview with CNBC's \"Closing Bell,\" he said that a 2024 listing was \"not impossible.\" In August, Bloomberg reported Klarna was close to selecting  Goldman Sachs  as the lead underwriter for its IPO in 2025. Siemiatkowski declined to comment on where the company will go public and said nothing has been confirmed yet on timing. Still, when it does go public, Klarna will be among the first major fintech names to successfully debut on a stock exchange in several years. Affirm , one of Klarna's closest competitors in the U.S.,  went public in 2021 . Afterpay, another Klarna competitor, was  acquired  by Jack Dorsey's payments company  Block  in 2021 for $29 billion. A study by venture capital firm Index Ventures last year found that, on average, employees at late-stage European startups own around 10% of the companies they work for, compared to 20% in the U.S. Out of a selection of 24 countries, the U.K. ranks highly overall. However, it does a poorer job when it comes to the administration burdens associated with treatment of these plans. Sweden, meanwhile, fares worse, performing badly on factors such as the scope of the plans and strike price, the Index study said. Asked whether he's worried Klarna employeesmay look to leave the company for an American tech firm instead, Siemiakowski said it's a \"risk,\" particularly as the firm is expanding aggressively in the U.S. \"The more prominent we become in the U.S market, the more people see us and recognize us and the more their LinkedIn inbox is going to be pinged by offers from others,\" Siemiatkowski told CNBC. He added that, in Europe, there's \"unfortunately a sentiment that you shouldn't pay that much to really talented people,\" especially when it comes to people working in the financial services industry. \"There is more of that sentiment than in the U.S., and that is unfortunately hurting competitiveness,\" Klarna's co-founder said. \"If you get approached by  Google , they will fix your visa. They will transfer you to the U.S. These issues that used to be there, they're not there anymore.\" \"The most talented pool is very mobile today,\" he added, noting that its now easier for staff to work remotely from a region that's outside a company's physical office space."

        "content": "Facebook parent company  Meta  on Wednesday said that it's working with two leading banks in the U.K. on an information-sharing arrangement to help protect consumers from fraud. Meta said it was expanding its Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange (FIRE) to enable U.K. banks to directly share information with the social media giant, in a bid to help it detect and take down scamming accounts and coordinated fraud schemes. Meta said that the tech has already been tested with multiple lenders in the U.K. In one example, Meta says it was able to take down 20,000 accounts from scammers engaged in a concert ticket scam network targeting people in the U.K. and U.S., thanks to data shared by British lenders NatWest and Metro Bank. NatWest and Metro Bank are the only banks in the U.K. that are currently part of the fraud information-sharing pact, but more are set to join later on, according to Meta. \"This work has already seen us take action against thousands of accounts run by scammers, indicating the importance of banks and platforms working together to tackle this societal issue,\"Nathaniel Gleicher, global head of counter-fraud at Meta, said in a statement Wednesday. \"We will only beat these criminals if we work together and share relevant information related to scams. Financial institutions can share unique information with us which we can in turn use to train our systems to take action against more scams globally,\" Gleicher added. Meta has long faced calls from banks in the U.K. to do more to stop scammers from running rampant on its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. In 2022, British digital bank Starling, which is backed by Goldman Sachs, began boycotting Meta and pulled advertising from its platforms over concerns that the company was failing to tackle fraudulent financial advertising. Meta's apps have been frequently abused by scammers attempting to swindle users out of their money through a variety of fraudulent schemes. One of the most common forms of scams users encounter on the company's platforms is authorized push payment fraud, through which criminals attempt to convince people to send them money by impersonating individuals or businesses that are selling a service. Meta already has policies in place banning promotion of financial fraud, such as loan scams and schemes promising high rates of returns. The firm also prohibits ads that promise unrealistic results or guarantee a financial return."

        "header": "With Hurricane Helene disrupting travel, here\u2019s what fliers need to know",
        "content": "As the Southeast U.S. recovers in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene's destruction, consumers looking to change their air travel plans to or from affected areas without  taking a financial hit  may be out of luck, experts said. \"The big-picture issue that happens in U.S. air travel: When there is a significant disruption, air passengers have very, very limited rights\" when it comes to compensation, said Eric Napoli, chief legal officer at AirHelp, an online service that assists airline passengers. Hurricane Helene  made landfall  Thursday in Florida as a Category 4 storm, leaving a  swath of wind- and flood-related damage  across Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. The storm killed  more than  120 people,  knocked out  power for millions of people and left many stranded without basic necessities like running water. The North Carolina Department of Transportation urged people to  avoid unnecessary travel  in the western part of the state due to hundreds of road closures from downed trees, landslides and \"catastrophic damage.\" Amid that destruction, travelers hoping to change flights for free or cancel their plans for a refund may find airlines unwilling to grant that financially flexibility. Airlines do generally  owe \"prompt\" refunds  to passengers if they cancel or make a \"significant change\" to a flight, regardless of the reason, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. That's true even for consumers with non-refundable tickets. More from Personal Finance: Rent a car for a road trip, or drive your own? 5 ways to maximize your vacation days What Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour says about 'passion tourism' However, weather-related events like Hurricane Helene are generally considered to be outside an airline's control, meaning passengers have relatively few rights to compensation, experts said. The airline's duty in such cases generally depends on a passenger's specific fare, such as economy or business class, Napoli said. \"There's nothing [airlines] will do for you\" if your conference was canceled and you don't have a ticket that grants free cancellation or comes without fees for changes, he said. Some airlines are making concessions tied to Hurricane Helene, though they vary by carrier and geography. \"All the rules are different,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at NerdWallet. Many major U.S. carriers have dedicated webpages for travel alerts outlining their policies around specific events, she said. For example,  American Airlines ,  Delta Airlines  and  United Airlines  have alerts about flooding in the Southeast. Many focus on areas around  Asheville, North Carolina , and some parts of Georgia like the  city of Valdosta . United is waiving change fees and fare differences for passengers whose flight was affected by flooding and who choose to reschedule their flight, for example. United's policy comes with parameters: Passengers must have purchased their ticket before Sept. 26, for travel between Sept. 30 and Oct. 31, 2024; the new flight must be a United flight leaving by the end of 2024 and between the same cities as originally booked. Those who cancel can get a full refund. American Airlines is also giving leeway to passengers scheduled to travel through Augusta, Georgia, between Sept. 29 and Oct. 4. They must book changes by Oct. 4. Delta passengers scheduled to fly through Asheville or Valdosta must travel on rebooked flights by Oct. 18 to avoid paying a fare difference. Change fees would still be waived past that date, however. Travel insurance isn't always a fail-safe in the event consumers can't get reimbursed from the travel provider for a flight, hotel or other travel expenses, experts said. If you didn't purchase a cancel-for-any-reason policy, your trip problems typically have to fall under specific, covered reasons. Plus, policies bought after Helene became a named storm generally won't cover claims related to it. \"Make sure you read the fine print and what the insurance is actually covering,\" Napoli said. Consumers who purchased their trip with a credit card may get certain travel reimbursement benefits from their card issuer, sometimes even in the case of severe weather, French said. Credit-card companies generally require a \"quick turnaround\" on a claim, often within 21 days, she said."

        "content": "Mastercard  said Tuesday that it's agreed to acquire Minna Technologies, a software firm that makes it easier for consumers to manage their subscriptions. The move comes as Mastercard and its primary payment network rival Visa are rapidly attempting to expand beyond their core credit and debit card businesses into technology services, such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and pay-by-bank payments. Mastercard declined to disclose financial details of the transaction which is currently subject to a regulatory review. The payments giant said that the deal, along with other initiatives it's committed to around subscriptions, will allow it to give consumers a way to access all their subscriptions in a single view  whether inside your banking app or a central \"hub.\" Minna Technologies, which is based in Gothenburg, Sweden, develops technology that helps consumers manage subscriptions within their banking apps and websites, regardless of which payment method they used for their subscriptions. The company said it works with some of the world's largest financial institutions in the world today. It already counts Mastercard as a key partner as well as its rival  Visa . \"These teams and technologies will add to the broader set of tools that help manage the merchant-consumer relationship and minimize any disruption in their experience,\" Mastercard said in a blog post Tuesday. Consumers today often have tons of subscriptions to manage across multiple services such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney Plus. Owning multiple subscriptions can make it difficult to cancel them as consumers can end up losing track of which subscriptions they're paying for and when. Mastercard noted that this can have a negative impact on merchants because consumers who aren't able to easily cancel their subscriptions end up calling on their banks to request a block on payments being taken. According to Juniper Research data, there are 6.8 billion subscriptions globally, a number that's expected to jump to 9.3 billion by 2028. Financial services incumbents such as Mastercard have been rapidly growing their product suite to remain competitive with emerging fintech players that are offering more convenient, digitally native ways to manage consumers' money management needs. In 2020, Mastercard acquired Finicity, a U.S. fintech firm that enables third parties such as fintechs or other banks to gain access to consumers' banking information and make payments on their behalf. Earlier this year, the company announced that by 2030, it would tokenize all cards issued on its network in Europe  in other words, as a consumer, you wouldn't need to enter your card details manually anymore and would only have to use your thumbprint to authenticate your identity when you pay. Visa, meanwhile, is also trying to remain competitive with fintech challengers. Last month, the company launched a  new service called Visa A2A , which makes it easier for consumers to set up and manage direct debits  payments which are taken directly from your bank account rather than by card."

        "content": "Charles Schwab  CEO Walt Bettinger is retiring from his role at the end of December after 16 years leading the brokerage firm, the company announced Tuesday. Bettinger will be replaced on Jan. 1, 2025, by Charles Schwab President Rick Wurster. Bettinger will remain as the co-chair of Schwabs board. In a statement, Bettinger cited his 65th birthday next year as a reason to step aside and praised the choice of Wurster. The Schwab Boards thoughtful and disciplined approach to succession planning helps make this transition smooth. Rick Wurster and I have worked together on a daily basis for more than eight years. I have complete confidence in his leadership, and I am thrilled that the Schwab Board of Directors has selected him as my successor, the statement said. In an interview on CNBCs  Squawk Box , Wurster indicated that there would not be any immediate change in strategy with the CEO handoff. I dont think there will be a transition in the sense that were going to continue what weve been doing, which is deliver for our clients and delight them, Wurster said. Since Bettinger took over in 2008, the companys client assets have grown to $9.74 trillion from $1.14 trillion, and client brokerage accounts have grown to more than 43 million from fewer than 10 million. This growth is due in part to Schwabs acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which closed in 2020. Bettinger said on Squawk Box that the integration of Ameritrade was completed earlier this year and was another reason that he thought this was a good time to step aside from the CEO role. Schwabs stock has gone up roughly 150% during Bettingers tenure, which began in the middle of the financial crisis, but it has underperformed the broader market over the past two years. I often say that not many CEOs halve their companys stock price in the first 90 days, but that was pretty much what I walked into in the financial crisis, Bettinger said on Squawk Box. Shares of Schwab fell 1.4% Tuesday as the broader stock market declined."

        "content": "London-based online trading platform Freetrade told CNBC Tuesday that it's agreed to buy the U.K. customer book of Stake, an Australian investing app. The move is part of a broader bid from Freetrade to bolster its domestic business and comes as British digital investment platforms face rising competition from new entrants not least U.S. heavyweight  Robinhood . The startup told CNBC exclusively that it entered into a transaction with Stake to take on all of the company's clients and move all assets the firm manages in the U.K. over to its own platform. Freetrade and Stake declined to disclose financial information of the deal, including the value of Stake's U.K. customer book. Stake, which is based in Sydney, Australia, was founded in 2017 by entrepreneurs Matt Leibowitz, Dan Silver and Jon Abitz with the aim of providing low-cost brokerage services to retail investors in Australia. The company, which also operates in New Zealand, launched its services in the U.K. in 2020. However, after a recent business review, Stake decided to focus primarily on its Australia and New Zealand operations. Following the deal, customers of Stake U.K. will be contacted with details about how to move their money and other assets over to Freetrade in \"the coming weeks,\" the companies said. Customers will still be able to use their Stake account until assets and cash are transferred to Freetrade in November. Freetrade operates primarily in the U.K. but has sought to expand into the European Union. It offers a range of investment products on its platform, including stocks, exchange-traded funds, individual savingsaccounts, and government bonds. As of April 2024, it had more than 1.4 million users. Earlier this year, CNBC reported that the startup's co-founder and CEO, Adam Dodds, had  decided to depart the company  after six years at the helm. He was replaced by Viktor Nebehaj, the firm's then-chief operating officer. Freetrade was a beneficiary of the 2020 and 2021 retail stock investing frenzy, which saw GameStop and other so-called \"meme stocks\" jump to wild highs. In the years that followed, Freetrade and its rivals, including Robinhood were impacted by higher interest rates which hammered investor sentiment. In 2022, Freetrade announced plans to lay off 15% of its workforce. The following year, the firm saw its valuation slump 65% to 225 million ($301 million) in an equity crowdfunding round. Freetrade at the time blamed a \"different market environment\" for the reduction in its market value. More recently, though, things have been turning around for the startup. Freetrade   reported its first-ever half year of profit in 2024, with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization hitting 91,000 in the six months through June. Revenues climbed 34% year-over-year, to 13.1 million. \"I'm focused on scaling Freetrade into the leading commission-free investment platform in the UK market,\" CEO Nebehaj said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"This deal shows our commitment to capitalise on opportunities for inorganic growth to reach that goal.\" \"Over the last few months, we have worked closely with Stake to ensure a smooth transition and good outcomes for their UK customers. We look forward to welcoming them and continuing to support them on their investment journeys.\" Freetrade currently manages more than 2 billion worth of assets for U.K. clients. Globally, Stake has over $2.9 billion in assets under administration. Robinhood, a far larger player in the U.S. with $144 billion in assets under management,  launched in the U.K. in November 2023 to much fanfare . Earlier this month, the company  launched a securities lending scheme in the U.K. , in a bid to further entice prospective British clients."

        "content": "Retail investing platform  Robinhood  on Tuesday announced that it's offering customers in Europe the ability to transfer cryptocurrencies in and out of its app, broadening its product capabilities in the region as it presses ahead with international expansion. In a blog post on Tuesday, the company said that it'll allow customers in the European Union to deposit and withdraw more than 20 digital currencies through its platform, including bitcoin, ethereum, solana, and USD coin. The move effectively gives Robinhood's European users the ability to \"self-custody\" assets  meaning that, rather than entrusting your cryptocurrency to a third-party platform, you can instead take ownership of it in a fully owned wallet that holds your funds. In December last year, Robinhood launched its crypto trading service, Robinhood Crypto, in the EU for the first time. The service allowed users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but not to move them away from the platform, either to another third-party platform or to their own self-custodial wallet. Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood's crypto unit, told CNBC that he thinks the EU has the potential to become an attractive market for digital currencies, thanks to crypto-friendly regulations being adopted by the bloc. \"The EU can become a very attractive market next year,\" Kerbrat said in an interview. He pointed to the EU's landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), regulation, which sets out harmonized rules for the crypto sector across all 27 of the bloc's member states. Once MiCA is fully in place, Kerbrat said, every EU country will fall under the same unified regime. \"In terms of total addressable market, [the EU] is as big as the U.S.,\" he told CNBC, adding, \"it's definitely an interesting market for us.\" Robinhood added that, for a limited time, the company will offer European customers the ability to get 1% of the value of tokens deposited on its platform back in the form of the equivalent cryptocurrency they transfer into Robinhood. Robinhood is rolling out new features in the EU at a time when U.S. crypto firms are sparring with regulators at home. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission has sued several companies including Coinbase, Binance and Ripple over claims that they're all dealing in unregistered securities. Each of the platforms has contested the SEC's allegations, stipulating that tokens marketed and sold on their platforms don't quality as securities that should be registered with the agency. \"We are disappointed by the way U.S. regulation is happening, where it's basically regulation by enforcement,\" Kerbret told CNBC. \"We are not super happy to see that.\" Robinhood is regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) at a federal level in the U.S. It also holds a BitLicense with New York State Department of Financial Services. In June, Robinhood announced that it would acquire Luxembourg-based crypto platform Bitstamp to take advantage of the firm's exchange technology and further expand its reach globally. The deal, which is valued at approximately $200 million in cash, is set to close in the first half of 2025. Kerbrat said that the company's deal to buy Bitstamp would help it gain access to even more international markets and obtain coveted regulatory permissions around the world. Bitstamp holds over 50 licenses and registrations globally including in Singapore, the U.K. and the EU. Beyond expanding globally, the deal with Bitstamp is also expected to help Robinhood diversify its crypto business to serve more institutional investors, Kerbrat told CNBC. For example, Bitstamp offers a \"crypto-as-a-service\" offering which helps banks and other financial firms launch their own crypto capabilities. Robinhood's crypto trading, deposit and withdrawal functionality are currently only available to customers in the European Union, not in the U.K. The company launched its popular stock trading service to Brits in November last year. However, it does not yet currently offer crypto services to U.K. clients."

        "content": "BEIJING  The rocket higher in Chinese stocks so far looks different from the market bubble in 2015, analysts said. Major mainland China stock indexes surged by more than 8% Monday, extending a winning streak on the back of stimulus hopes. Trading volume on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges hit 2.59 trillion yuan ($368.78 billion), surpassing a high of 2.37 trillion yuan on May 28, 2015, according to Wind Information. Over six months from 2014 to 2015, the Chinese stock market doubled in value, while leverage climbed, Aaron Costello, regional head for Asia at Cambridge Associates, pointed out Monday. This time around, the market hasn't run up as much, while leverage is lower, he said. \"We're not in the danger zone yet.\" Stock market leverage by percentage and value were far higher in 2015 than data for Monday showed, according to Wind Information. The Shanghai Composite in June 2015 soared past 5,100 points, a level it has never regained since a market plunge later that summer. MSCI that year delayed adding the mainland Chinese stocks to its globally tracked emerging markets index. Also hitting sentiment was Beijing's back-and-forth on a  crackdown on trading with borrowed funds  and a surprise devaluation of the  Chinese yuan  against the U.S. dollar. This year, the yuan is trading stronger against the greenback, while foreign institutional allocation to Chinese stocks has fallen to  multi-year lows . The Shanghai Composite closed at 3,336.5 on Monday, before mainland exchanges closed for a week-long holiday commemorating the 75th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. Trading is set to resume on Oct. 8. In the runup to the 2015 market rally, Chinese state media had  encouraged stock market investment , while loose rules allowed people to buy stocks with borrowed funds. Beijing has long sought to build up its domestic stock market, which at roughly 30 years old is far younger than that of the U.S. The latest market gains follow announcements in the last week of economic support and programs to encourage institutions to put more money into stocks. The news helped stocks rebound from roughly their lowest levels of the year. The CSI 300 rallied by nearly 16% in its  best week since 2008 . Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday led a  high-level meeting  that called for halting the real estate market's decline as well as strengthening fiscal and monetary policy. The People's Bank of China last week also  cut interest rates  and the amount existing mortgage holders need to pay. \"The policy is much stronger and [more] concerted this time than 2015. That said, the economy faces greater headwind[s] right now compared to back then,\" said Zhu Ning, author of \"China's Guaranteed Bubble.\" One week of massive stock gains do not mean the economy is on its way to a similar recovery. The CSI 300 remains more than 30% below its February 2021 high, a level that had even surpassed the index's 2015 high. \"The Japanese experience provides an important perspective, as the Nikkei 225 Index bounced four times by an average of 34 per cent on its way to a 66 per cent cumulative drop from December 1989 to September 1998,\" Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center, pointed out Tuesday in a  blog post  that was also published in the Financial Times opinion section. Economic data for the last few months have pointed to  slower growth in retail sales  and manufacturing. That raised  concerns that China's gross domestic product  would not reach the full-year target of around 5% without additional stimulus. \"I think what's missing is the key to a lot of this, that has not come out, which would be a truly confidence-boosting measure, is how are they going to  fix the local government finances ,\" Costello said, noting local coffers once relied on land sales for revenue to spend on public services. While Chinese authorities have cut interest rates and eased some home buying restrictions, the Ministry of Finance has yet to announce additional debt issuance to support growth. Peter Alexander, founder and managing director of Z-Ben Advisors, expects the level of fiscal stimulus  when it's likely announced in late October  to be less than what markets are hoping for. It \"may have investors a little bit over their skis, as people like to say,\" he said Monday on CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia .\" He added in a written response that his experiences in 2007 and 2015 indicate the Chinese stock market rally could last for another three to six months, or abruptly end. \"This is pure animal instincts and the Chinese have been pent up for a stock market rally,\" Alexander said. He added that there are market risks from how unprepared the stock trading system was for the surge of buying. Data on the number of new retail investors in China this year wasn't publicly available.  Reports  indicate brokerages have been overwhelmed with new requests, echoing how individuals piled into the stock market nearly a decade earlier. The Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday said confirming transactions at the market open had been  abnormally slow. \"China was cheap and was missing the catalyst. ... The catalyst has occurred to unlock the value,\" Costello said. \"Fundamentally we need to see corporate earnings go up,\" he said. \"If that doesn't go up, this is all a short-term pop.\" Beijing's efforts earlier this year to stem a market rout included changing the head of the securities regulator. Stocks climbed, only to see the rally peter out in May. A factor that can send stocks past May levels is that earnings per share forecasts have stabilized versus downgrades earlier this year, James Wang, head of China strategy at UBS Investment Bank Research, said in a note Monday. Lower U.S. interest rates, a stronger Chinese yuan, increased share buybacks and more coordinated policymaker response also support gains, he said. Wang's latest price target of $70 on the MSCI China index is now just a few cents above where it closed Monday.  CNBC's Hui Jie Lim contributed to this report."

        "content": "BEIJING  Chinese President  Xi Jinping  said Monday that no challenges can stop the country from moving forward and reiterated Beijing's reunification aims with Taiwan. He was speaking at a reception commemorating the 75th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, which was founded on Oct.1, 1949. \"The path ahead will definitely see challenges,\" Xi said, before calling on the country to overcome uncertainties and risks. \"No challenges can stop China's progress.\" The comments were translated by CNBC from a Chinese state media broadcast. The brief speech, aired during the state broadcaster's daily evening news program, noted that Xi and other top Chinese leaders entered the reception shortly after 5 p.m. local time on Monday. About 3,000 people, including foreigners, attended the event in Beijing, according to state media. During his speech, Xi emphasized the need to unify under the Chinese Communist Party's leadership and reiterated Beijing's \"firm opposition\" to Taiwan \"separatist\" activities, while calling for both sides to increase economic and cultural cooperation. He cast reunification with Taiwan as an inevitable development of history  something he has said previously. Beijing considers the democratically self-ruled island as a part of its territory. Tensions between China and the U.S. and Europe have increased over the last several years, with Western nations increasing tariffs and restrictions on Beijing's access to advanced technology. Xi did not mention specific countries or trade conflicts in his Monday speech, instead portraying China as upholding globalization. He broadly thanked \"friendly\" countries and supporters of China's development. He also emphasized Beijing's claim to Greater China by saying \"national rejuvenation\" was the hope of Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and all Chinese peoples. The Beijing leader added that China would \"spur\" the development of Hong Kong and Macao  both self-governed regions which are ruled by Beijing under the \"one country, two systems\" principle. In a 2019 speech commemorating the PRC's 70th anniversary, Xi had said that  no force could sway China's development , amid festivities involving a military parade and large-scale celebrations. Events for the 65th anniversary were more subdued. Xi's speech comes at a time of uptick in Chinese markets in recent weeks, with major mainland Chinese and Hong Kong stock indexes  recently surging  to their highest in more than a year after authorities announced plans to support economic growth. On Thursday, a high-level meeting led by Xi called for halting the real estate decline, and for strengthening fiscal and monetary policy. While the People's Bank of China has cut rates in the last week, the Ministry of Finance has yet to announce additional fiscal support."

The CSI 300, an index of stocks traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rallied more than 15% last week, its best week since 2008 . Earlier this year, the CSI 300 fell to six-year-lows. \"There is no question that shares of quality businesses will bottom well ahead of final index bottoms,\" a team led by JPMorgan chief China equity strategist Wendy Liu wrote in a report Friday. Until the government's measures pan out, investment strategists are recommending a handful of oversold stocks in China.

Adding exposure That newfound enthusiasm was contagious. \"We believe it is a good time to add back China exposure,\" said Rupal Agarwal, Asia quantitative strategist at Bernstein, in a note Friday. \"We would wait to see clear signs of inflection on property/consumer sentiment and earnings growth to become more positive over the medium-term,\" she said. \"For now, we believe tactically, the rally has legs.\" Two stocks Bernstein analysts found that have triple-digit six-month earnings momentum are U.S.-listed after-school operator Tal Education and Shanghai-listed Seres , which manufactures cars for the Aito EV brand developed with Huawei.

U.S. hedge fund billionaire David Tepper said Thursday on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" that he bought more Chinese stocks after the change in China policy. Asked about the potential impact of increased U.S. tariffs, which former President Donald Trump has promised to extend if elected in November, Tepper said he didn't care. Instead, Tepper stressed how Beijing's latest policy focuses on \"internal stimulus,\" and said Chinese stocks are cheaper than those in the U.S. \"You're sitting there with single multiple P/Es with double-digit growth rate s for the big stocks that trade over here,\" Tepper said. That's versus, \"you know, the 20-plus on the S & P.\" Shifting sentiment Sentiment toward Chinese stocks shifted after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng on Tuesday announced rate cuts at a rare press conference held alongside the head of securities regulation and other officials. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday then led a high-level meeting that affirmed those policy moves. The leaders also called for a halt in the real estate slump and for strengthening fiscal and monetary policy. In reaction to the brightened prospects, short-term traders have bought Chinese stocks for eight straight days, Scott Rubner, managing director for global markets and tactical specialist at Goldman Sachs, said in a trading note Thursday. \"Re-Emerging Markets have quickly become a favored post-U.S. election trade for November and December,\" Rubner said, noting, \"I have done more Zoom calls on China in the past 48 hours than all of 2024.\" Global mutual funds in aggregate allocated 5.1% of their portfolios to Chinese stocks as of the end of August, near the lowest levels of the past decade, while hedge funds were around a five-year low of less than 7%, according to data collected by Goldman. That hedge fund allocation rose to 7.3% on Tuesday, which saw the largest single day purchases by hedge funds since March 2021, Rubner said. .SZSC 1Y mountain Shenzhen Stock Exchange Composite Index over the past 12 months. The renewed interest in Chinese stocks comes after institutions had cut their exposure there due to sluggish growth prospects, mounting debt woes and an alarming slump in the property market . Some international investors have also steered clear over concerns about U.S.-China tensions. To be sure, few are betting on an unimpeded, all-out rally from here, especially since China hasn't formalized the details of fiscal policy. Chinese companies trade primarily in the U.S., Hong Kong and the mainland. Retail investors account for the majority of trading activity in mainland Chinese stocks, also known as A shares. \"Trading sentiment has always been affected by policies and has fluctuated greatly,\" Li Dongfang, a Beijing-based finance blogger, said in Chinese, translated by CNBC. He bought some A shares and Hong Kong-traded exchange traded funds, and is optimistic on liquor, new energy vehicle and photovoltaic stocks. \"The A share market has always had a market bottom after the policy\" starts to turn supportive, Li said, noting he expects it will take time for the market to consolidate after the latest gains followed earlier losses. The PBOC's policy announcements support further flows into the stock market, allowing ETFs to be used as collateral for institutional loans, and allowing major shareholders to borrow from banks for stock repurchases, Li said. \"Ongoing short squeeze likely further fueled the strong market performance [Friday], with property, consumer staples, and consumer discretionary outperforming in the HK market, and property, consumer staples, and financials outperforming in the A-share market,\" JPMorgan said.

        "header": "Why JPMorgan Chase is prepared to sue the U.S. government over Zelle scams",
        "content": "Buried in a roughly 200-page quarterly  filing  from  JPMorgan Chase  last month were eight words that underscore how contentious the bank's relationship with the government has become. The lender disclosed that the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  could punish JPMorgan for its role in Zelle, the giant peer-to-peer digital payments network. The bank is accused of failing to kick criminal accounts off its platform and failing to compensate some scam victims,according to people who declined to be identified speaking about an ongoing investigation. In response, JPMorgan issued a thinly veiled threat: \"The firm is evaluating next steps, including litigation.\" The prospect of a bank suing its regulator would've been unheard of in an earlier era, according to policy experts, mostly because corporations used to fear provoking their overseers. That was especially the case for the American banking industry, which needed hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts to survive after irresponsible lending and trading activities caused the 2008 financial crisis, those experts say. But a combination of factors in the intervening years has created an environment where banks and their regulators have never been farther apart. Trade groups say that in the aftermath of the financial crisis, banks became easy targets for populist attacks from Democrat-led regulatory agencies. Those on the side of regulators point out that banks and their lobbyists increasingly lean on  courts  in Republican-dominated districts to fend off reform and protect billions of dollars in fees at the expense of consumers. \"If you go back 15 or 20 years, the view was it's not particularly smart to antagonize your regulator, that litigating all this stuff is just kicking the hornet's nest,\" said  Tobin Marcus , head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research. \"The disparity between how ambitious [President Joe] Biden's regulators have been and how conservative the courts are, at least a subset of the courts, is historically wide,\" Marcus said. \"That's created so many opportunities for successful industry litigation against regulatory proposals.\" Those forces collided this year, which started out as one of the most consequential for bank regulation since the post-2008 reforms that  curbed  Wall Street risk-taking, introduced annual stress  tests  and created the industry's lead antagonist, the CFPB. In the final months of the  Biden  administration, efforts from a half-dozen government agencies were meant to slash fees on credit card late payments, debit transactions and overdrafts, among other proposals. The industry's biggest threat was the Basel Endgame, a  sweeping  plan to force big banks to hold tens of billions of dollars more in capital for activities like trading and lending. \"The industry is facing an onslaught of regulatory and potential legislative change,\"  Marianne Lake , head of JPMorgan's consumer bank, warned investors in May. JPMorgan's disclosure about the CFPB probe into Zelle comes after years of  grilling  by Democrat lawmakers over financial crimes on the platform. Zelle was launched in 2017 by a bank-owned firm called  Early Warning Services  in response to the threat from peer-to-peer networks including  PayPal. The vast majority of Zelle activity is uneventful; of the $806 billion that flowed across the network last year, only $166 million in transactions was disputed as fraud by customers of JPMorgan,  Bank of America  and  Wells Fargo , the three biggest players on the platform. But the three banks collectively reimbursed just 38% of those claims, according to a July Senate  report  that looked at disputed unauthorized transactions. Banks are typically on the hook to reimburse fraudulent Zelle payments that the customer didn't give permission for, but usually don't refund losses if the customer is duped into authorizing the payment by a scammer,  according  to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. A JPMorgan payments executive  told  lawmakers in July that the bank actually reimburses 100% of unauthorized transactions; the discrepancy in the Senate report's findings is because bank personnel often determine that customers have authorized the transactions. Amid the scrutiny, the bank began warning Zelle users on the Chase app to \"Stay safe from scams\" and added disclosures that customers won't likely be refunded for bogus transactions. JPMorgan declined to comment for this article. The company, which has grown to become the largest and most profitable American bank in history under CEO  Jamie Dimon , is at the fore of several other skirmishes with regulators. Thanks to his reputation guiding JPMorgan through the 2008 crisis and last year's regional banking upheaval, Dimon may be one of few CEOs with the standing to openly criticize regulators. That was highlighted this year when Dimon led a campaign, both public and behind  closed doors , to weaken the Basel proposal. In May, at JPMorgan's investor day, Dimon's deputies made the case that Basel and other regulations would end up harming consumers instead of protecting them. The cumulative effect of pending regulation would boost the cost of mortgages by at least $500 a year and credit card rates by 2%; it would also force banks to charge two-thirds of consumers for checking accounts, according to JPMorgan. The message: banks won't just eat the extra costs from regulation, but instead pass them on to consumers. While all of these battles are ongoing, the financial industry has racked up several victories so far. Some contend the threat of litigation helped convince the Federal Reserve to  offer a new  Basel Endgame proposal this month that roughly cuts in half the extra capital that the largest institutions would be forced to hold, among other industry-friendly changes. It's not even clear if the watered-down version of the proposal, a long-in-the-making response to the 2008 crisis, will ever be implemented because it won't be finalized until well after U.S. elections. If Republican candidate Donald Trump wins, the rules might be further weakened or killed outright, and even under a Kamala Harris administration, the industry could fight the regulation in court. That's been banks' approach to the CFPB credit card rule, which aimed to cap late fees at $8 per incident and was set to go into effect in May. A last-ditch effort from the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce  and bank trade groups successfully delayed its implementation when  Judge Mark Pittman  of the Northern District of Texas sided with the industry, granting a  freeze  of the rule. A key playbook for banks has been to file cases in conservative jurisdictions where they are likely to prevail, according to  Lori Yue , a Columbia Business School associate professor who has studied the interplay between corporations and the judicial system. The Northern District of Texas feeds into the  5th Circuit  Court of Appeals, which is \"well-known for its friendliness to industry lawsuits against regulators,\" Yue said. \"Venue-shopping like this has become well-established corporate strategy,\" Yue said. \"The financial industry has been particularly active this year in suing regulators.\" Since 2017, nearly  two-thirds  of the lawsuits filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce challenging federal regulations have been in courts under the  5th Circuit , according to an analysis by  Accountable US . Industries dominated by a few large players  from banks to airlines, pharmaceutical companies and energy firms  tend to have well-funded trade organizations that are more likely to resist regulators, Yue added. The polarized environment, where  weakened  federal agencies are undermined by conservative courts, ultimately preserves the advantages of the largest corporations, according to  Brian Graham , co-founder of bank consulting firm Klaros. \"It's really bad in the long run, because it locks in place whatever the regulations have been, while the reality is that the world is changing,\" Graham said. \"It's what happens when you can't adopt new regulations because you're terrified that you'll get sued.\"  With data visualizations by CNBC's Gabriel Cortes."

        "header": "States forge ahead with Inflation Reduction Act energy rebates \u2014 so far, South Dakota is the only one to opt out",
        "content": "A handful of states have rolled out rebates to consumers who make their homes more energy-efficient, just months after New York  became the first state  to do so, in May. Meanwhile, South Dakota officials in August declined the federal funding, which is tied to two new programs created by the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark climate law enacted in 2022. The IRA  earmarked $8.8 billion  for consumers via two Home Energy Rebates programs. Consumers can access up to $8,000 of  Home Efficiency Rebates , and up to $14,000 of  Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates . More from Personal Finance: Take a look inside a $1.1 million 'zero emissions' home How EVs and gasoline cars compare on total cost How to buy renewable energy from your electric utility Together, the two rebate programs aim to defray  or in some cases fully offset  the cost of retrofitting homes and upgrading appliances to be more energy-efficient. Such tweaks can help consumers cut their utility bills while also reducing planet-warming carbon emissions, officials said. The two programs have varying rules that determine which consumers are eligible and how much money they can access. In some cases, rebates will depend on household income and a home's overall energy reduction. Nearly every state has indicated it will launch a rebate program for residents, according to a U.S. Department of Energy spokesperson. State officials had an August deadline to officially decline the federal funds. They have a Jan. 31, 2025  deadline  to submit a program application to the DOE. South Dakota is the only state so far to have signaled publicly that it won't administer the rebates. \"With good faith, we did look into this,\" Jim Terwilliger, commissioner of the South Dakota Bureau of Finance and Management,  said  during a July 30  appropriations hearing . \"We just don't believe that it's the right thing for South Dakota.\" States, which administer the federal funds, have some leeway relative to program design. They must apply for funding and can distribute rebates to consumers after their application is approved. New York  launched the first phase  of its rebates May 30. Five others  Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Wisconsin   have since launched rebate programs , too, according to U.S. Department of Energy data as of Sept. 24. \"I'm expecting more and more to roll out,\" said Kara Saul-Rinaldi, president and CEO of AnnDyl Policy Group, a consulting firm focused on climate and energy policy. Many more states, as well as Washington, D.C., have submitted applications or had them approved, according to DOE data: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. Together, these 26 states plus the District of Columbia have applied for $4 billion in total funding so far, the DOE said. The rebates are a new program, and \"complex government programs like these take time and coordination to set up,\" according to a DOE spokesperson. \"The Inflation Reduction Act put states in charge of designing and implementing Home Energy Rebate programs that fit their local needs,\" the spokesperson wrote in an e-mail. \"As each state has different resources and capabilities, each state's timeline will be different.\" However, South Dakota officials in August signaled they wouldn't participate, the lone state so far to decline the federal rebate funding. \"South Dakota will have no part in facilitating the Green New Deal,\" Ian Fury, a spokesperson for Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, said in an e-mailed statement. States had an  Aug. 16, 2024 deadline  to officially decline the funds. \"We don't think the administrative burden and the expense of administering a program like that is the appropriate thing to do, and we generally disagree with the policy,\" Terwilliger, of the South Dakota Bureau of Finance and Management, said in a July hearing. The Inflation Reduction Act allows states to  use up to 20%  of its funding for administrative purposes. Fifty-one states and territories have applied to DOE for early administrative funding, the agency said. The  $68.6 million  of federal money that had been set aside for South Dakota rebates will be redistributed among participating states. Fury also noted this isn't the first time South Dakota has rejected federal spending. It was the only state to  reject extended unemployment benefits  in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, Fury said. The Green New Deal is a climate-change policy initiative supported by congressional Democrats starting  around 2019 . Bipartisan legislation to create an energy rebate program had existed almost a decade earlier, like the  Home Star Energy Retrofit Act  in 2010. The concept of consumer rebates tied to energy efficiency \"predates the Green New Deal by many years,\" said Saul-Rinaldi. It appears Florida officials reversed course from their original stance on the rebates. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2023 had vetoed the state's authority to spend about $5 million of federal funds to administer the energy rebate program. At the time, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services told CNBC that Florida wouldn't be applying for the rebates as a result. Now, Florida  is preparing  for a soft launch of the rebate programs in late 2024 and a full launch in early 2025, according to information on a  state website . A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn't return a request for comment on the change in position. At a high level, consumers will be able to get the rebates at the point of sale, when they buy an appliance directly from a retailer or from a qualified contractor who's helping a household complete an efficiency project. \"Every state is approaching [its program] differently, for many reasons,\" Saul-Rinaldi said. Many are rolling them out in phases. For example, New Mexico is starting by  offering a $1,600 rebate  for low-income consumers in single-family homes who buy insulation from a participating retailer. Similar to other states, qualifying New Mexico residents will be able to later access additional rebates such as: Consumers and contractors should consult their state energy department website to learn more about their specific programs and eligibility, Saul-Rinaldi said. The U.S. Energy Department suggests households don't wait to accomplish necessary home energy upgrades or projects if their state hasn't formally rolled out rebates. They may be eligible for other federal programs, \"including  tax credits , the  Weatherization Assistance Program , and other  state, local, and utility programs ,\" the agency  said ."

        "content": "BEIJING  China's latest policy signals have a bigger impact on sentiment than resolving deeper issues such as real estate, analysts said. The Shanghai Composite rallied Thursday to close at a three-month high after state media reported Chinese President  Xi Jinping  led a  Politburo meeting on the economy  that morning. The unexpected high-level gathering called for halting the property market decline, and strengthening fiscal and monetary policy. It provided few specifics, while affirming  central bank rate cuts  announced earlier in the week. Markets should value how Beijing is recognizing the severity of the economic situation, and how its piecemeal approach so far hasn't worked, Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a report Friday. \"The 'shock and awe' strategy could be meant to jumpstart the markets and boost confidence,\" Lu said, but eventually it is still necessary to introduce well thought out policies to address many of the \"deep-rooted problems.\" Growth in the world's second-largest economy has slowed, dragged down by the real estate slump. Retail sales have risen by barely more than 2% in recent months, and industrial profits have  barely grown for the first eight months of the year . Exports are one of the few bright spots. Nomura's Lu said policymakers in particular need to stabilize property since it is in its fourth year of contraction. He estimated the impact of additional stimulus wouldn't exceed 3% of China's annual GDP. \"Markets should place more emphasis on the specifics of the stimulus,\" Lu said. \"If not designed well, a stimulus program in a haste, even if seemingly large, could have a slow and limited impact on growth.\" The People's Bank of China this week cut major interest rates, and announced plans to lower rates for existing mortgage holders. The Ministry of Finance has yet to release major policies,  despite reports  of such plans. For some investment institutions, that's still not enough to move the needle on their China outlook. \"China's policy moves to lower interest rates have not helped improve confidence among consumers who are fearful of borrowing in the first place,\" Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in an email. \"We would be selling emerging market equities at this point,\" he said, \"as we have little confidence in Beijing's willingness to extend the large stimulus that is needed.\" Christopher added that Thursday's \"announcement of coming fiscal stimulus is welcome, but it remains to be seen if China's government is willing to take the steps necessary to reverse the psychological damage to household and private business sentiment.\" The Chinese government has cracked down on real estate developers, after-school tutoring businesses and the gaming industry in recent years. Policymakers have since eased their stance, but business and consumer confidence has yet to recover. China's latest interest rate cuts follow the U.S. Federal Reserve's shift last week to easier monetary policy. U.S rate cuts theoretically give China's central bank more room to reduce already-low domestic rates. A survey in September of more than 1,200 companies in China by the U.S.-based China Beige Book found that corporate borrowing declined, despite historic lows in the costs to do so. \"One can certainly hope for a wealth effect from stocks and property, but stocks will be temporary and the wealth decline from property is overwhelming compared to any relief,\" Shehzad Qazi, chief operating officer at the China Beige Book, a U.S.-based research firm, said in a note Thursday. He expects retail sales could pick up slightly in the next four to six months. Qazi also expects the latest rally in Chinese stocks to continue into the last three months of the year. But cautioned that policies announced this week for driving more capital into the stock market \"are not yet operational, and some may never be.\" Those caveats haven't discouraged investors from piling into beaten-down Chinese stocks. The CSI 300 stock index climbed Friday,  on pace for its best week since 2008 . It could rise another 10% in the near term, Laura Wang, chief China equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia .\" The sentiment shift has spread globally. \"I thought that what the Fed did last week would lead to China easing, and I didn't know that they were going to bring out the big guns like they did,\" U.S. billionaire hedge fund founder  David Tepper told  CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" on Thursday. \"And I think there's a whole shift.\" Tepper said he bought more Chinese stocks this week. An important takeaway from Thursday's high-level government meeting was the support for capital markets, in contrast to a more negative perception in China on the financial industry in recent years, said Bruce Liu, CEO of Esoterica Capital, an asset manager. \"Hopefully this meeting is going to correct this misperception,\" he said. \"For China to keep growing in a healthy way, [they] really need a well-functioning capital market.\" \"I don't think they sent any different messages,\" Liu said. \"It's just [that] they emphasize it with detailed action plans. That made a difference.\""

I probably said a long time ago, I don't go above 10% or 15%. Well, that's probably not true anymore.\" In fact, the founder of Appaloosa Management said he may have doubled his limit to China equities, saying he bought more of \"everything\" such as large-cap tech giants Alibaba and Baidu after the U.S. lowered interest rates earlier this month. \"It's everything. Now, I would love to see a pullback, OK,\" he said. \"I will have another newfound limit, OK, in a pullback.\" Tepper has grown optimistic on the China market this month after state media on Thursday afternoon said Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top leaders affirmed the government's efforts to stimulate the economy. That comes after China earlier this week unveiled interest rate cuts , as well as other measures to support the property market. \"They promised to do more and more and more. OK? And that's very strange language, especially for, you know, any central banker, but especially over there,\" Tepper said. \"And last night, you know, we heard that they were going to have some kind of meeting, but they kind of blew away expectations on the fiscal stimulus.\" FXI 1D mountain iShares China Large-Cap ETF The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) rallied more than 6% following Tepper's comments, extending its gains from a winning session for Chinese and Hong Kong stocks. Tepper also noted the Chinese market is cheaper than U.S. equities. \"You're sitting there with single multiple P/Es with double-digit growth rates for the big stocks that trade over here,\" Tepper said. \"That's kind of versus what, you know, the 20-plus on the S & P.\" As part of a China play, Tepper said that he would buy Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands . The casino stocks popped 7% and nearly 6%, respectively. To be sure, rising geopolitical concerns including further tariffs between the U.S. and China have spooked many investors away from the China market. However, Tepper dismissed those risks. \"My counter bet is that I don't care,\" he said."

        "content": "OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar is looking to reassure its investors that the richly valued artificial intelligence startup is still in a strong position and is poised to close a big funding round soon, despite losing top talent this week. In an email to OpenAI's investors seen by CNBC, Friar addressed the  departure  of Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati, who announced her exit on Wednesday. Later that day, Sam Altman said two top research executives, Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, were also leaving. \"I wanted to personally reach out following the news of Mira's departure from OpenAI,\" Friar wrote. \"While leadership changes are never easy, I want to ensure you have the full context.\" Friar added that, \"We are incredibly proud of everything she's helped build,\" and said the San Francisco-based company still has a \"talented leadership bench\" to compete. OpenAI, which is backed by  Microsoft  and recently partnered with  Apple  on its AI for iPhones, is in the midst of closing a $6.5 billion  funding round , which should value the company at roughly $150 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter. Thrive Capital is leading the round, and plans to invest $1 billion, according to the sources. Friar said in the email that the funding round was oversubscribed and would close by next week. She said the team plans to host a series of calls with investors to introduce the group to key leaders from product and research teams. \"Collectively, we remain laser-focused on bringing AI to everyone and building sustainable revenue models that fuel our operations and deliver value to our investors and employees,\" Friar wrote. The company is \"excited for you to be with us as we enter our next chapter,\" she wrote. OpenAI declined to comment on the email. Murati's departure comes after 6 years at the company. She briefly served as interim CEO last year after the board of directors  abruptly fired Altman . When Altman was quickly reinstated, Murati returned to the role of CTO. The company was already dealing with the loss of key executives. Co-founder John Schulman and safety chief Jan Leike left to join rival Anthropic. Co-founder Ilya Sutskever departed to start another AI company, while another founder, Greg Brockman, is on a leave of absence. Friar said Mark Chen will step into the role of of senior vice president of research, and leaders like Kevin Weil, who joined from  Meta , and Srinivas Narayanan are the \"right people to keep pushing the boundaries of innovation.\" Friar was formerly CEO of  Nextdoor , and before that CFO at  Block , formerly Square. Also on Thursday, at an all-hands meeting, Altman  denied  that there are plans for him to receive a \"giant equity stake\" in the company, calling reports of such a development \"just not true,\" according to a person who was in attendance. Altman and Friar both said at the meeting, conducted by video, that investors have raised concerns about Altman not having equity in the company that he co-founded almost nine years ago, said the person, who asked not to be named because the gathering was only for employees.

        "content": "Appaloosa Management's David Tepper said investors should believe the Federal Reserve when it says it will lower interest rates because the central bank has now to keep credibility. \"You just read what these guys are saying,\" Tepper said Thursday on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\" \"Powell told you something. ... He told you some kind of recalibration. He has to follow through somewhat. I'm not that smart. I just read what they say and do they have conviction. They usually do what they say, especially when they have this level of conviction.\" The Fed last week  sliced half a percentage point off benchmark rates , starting its first easing campaign in four years with an aggressive move despite a pretty stable economy. In addition to this reduction, the central bank indicated through its \"dot plot\" the equivalent of 50 more basis points of cuts by the end of the year . Fed Chairman  Jerome Powell  said the cut was a \"recalibration\" for the central bank and did not commit to similar moves at each upcoming meeting. \"Probably two or three interest rates, 25 basis point cuts, they have to do, or they lose credibility,\" Tepper said. \"They're going to do something besides the 50. You know, another 25, 25, 25 seems like it's going to have to be done.\" (One basis point equals 0.01%.) Still, Tepper said the macro setup for U.S. stocks makes him nervous as the Fed eases monetary policy in a relatively solid economy like it did in the 1990s. The supersized rate cut last week came despite most economic indicators looking fairly solid. \"It was around the '90s in that market where the Fed cut rates into Y2K in a good economy,\" he said. That turned into \"bubble mania in '99, early 2000 so I don't love this. I'm a value guy.\" Gross domestic product has been rising steadily, and the Atlanta Fed is tracking 3% growth in the third quarter based on the resilience in consumer spending. Meanwhile, most gauges showed inflation is still well ahead of the Fed's 2% target. However, there has been a slowdown in the labor market, which partly prompted the oversized rate reduction. The widely followed hedge fund manager said while the central bank's move gave him hesitation, he certainly is not betting against U.S. equities because of the immediate benefits of easy policy. \"I don't love the U.S. markets on a value standpoint, but I sure as heck won't be short, because I would be nervous as heck about the setup with easy money everywhere, a relatively good economy,\" Tepper said. \"It would make me nervous, not to be somewhat long the U.S.\" Tepper, who is also the owner ofNational Football League's Carolina Panthers franchise, revealed that he's going all in on China on the back of  a rate cut  and a flood of support measures  the government recently announced to shore up a flailing economy. He added that he prefers Asian and European equities to U.S. stocks."

        "header": "Sterling plunges more than 1% against the dollar, euro after Bank of England governor's comments on rates",
        "content": "LONDON  The British pound tumbled more than 1% against the U.S. dollar and euro on Thursday after Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey suggested more positive inflation data could lead the central bank toward a more aggressive approach to interest rate cuts. Sterling was down 1.16% to $1.3113 at 4:45 p.m. in London, slightly paring losses of more than 1.3% but still hovering near its lowest intraday level since Sept. 12. The drop put sterling on course for its steepest daily decline against the greenback for more than 20 months, according to a CNBC calculation of LSEG data. Bailey  told the Guardian newspaper  in an interview published on Thursday that the BOE could become \"a bit more activist\" in its approach to rate cuts if inflation developments continued to be good. He also said he was encouraged that cost of living pressures had not been as persistent as previously thought, according to the Guardian. The  pound was buoyed  following the  BOE's monetary policy meeting  on Sept. 19, as British policymakers struck a more hawkish tone than those at the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. It also found support over the summer from the decisive victory of the Labour party in the early July general election, with investors eyeing a period of political stability and the  potential for pro-business reforms . The  upcoming budget , due to be announced at the end of October, had already caused some to question whether optimism around U.K. assets can hold, with political leaders  repeatedly suggesting  that tax hikes and public spending discipline will be required to meet a budget shortfall. The pound meanwhile dropped 1.1%. against the euro Thursday, trading at its lowest level since Sept. 20. The drop put sterling on course for its steepest daily decline against the greenback for more than 20 months, according to a CNBC calculation of LSEG data. That came despite several analysts hiking their outlooks for the pace of European Central Bank rate cuts this year, after  euro zone  and  German  inflation prints both came in below 2% this week. Bank of America Global Research and Moody's Analytics were among the teams to say they now expected a 25 basis point rate cut from the ECB at its upcoming October meeting, along with a follow-up reduction at its next and final gathering of the year in December. BOA Global Research said it now saw the ECB's deposit rate at 2% by June 2025, a quarter earlier than its previous forecast. The Bank of England held its key rate in September, after cutting it by 25 basis points in August to 5%. During the September meeting, the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee expressed concerns about services inflation and wage growth, despite  headline inflation hovering near its 2% target . Money market pricing on Thursday suggested a high probability of two more 25-basis-point cuts from the BOE this year across its remaining meetings. \"One simple interpretation of the Governor's comments is that it could now take an upside surprise to inflation for the MPC not to cut rates back-to-back in November and December. Previously the guidance suggested that the burden of proof was on inflation to surprise to the downside for such a shift away from the \"gradual\" pace of easing,\" Shreyas Gopal, FX strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a research note. Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING, said the \"pound correction\" may extend to the 1.3 mark in the near term as a \"probably long-due dovish repricing\" meets higher U.S. dollar swap rates, he added. Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank London, said in a Thursday note that Bailey's recent comments on the potential for more aggressive rate cuts had \"deeply shaken\" support for sterling  but noted that the interview also featured the governor discussing potential risks to the inflationary outlook from a spike in crude oil prices, following the latest flare in Middle East tensions. Bailey told the Guardian: \"Geopolitical concerns are very serious... There are obviously stresses and the real issue then is how they might interact with some still quite stretched markets in places.\" The central bank had been helped by not having to deal with major oil price hikes so far, but it was watching the situation \"extremely closely\" for potential impacts, Bailey said. \"My sense from all the conversations I have with counterparts in the region, is that there is, for the moment, a strong commitment to keep the market stable,\" he continued. Rabobank's Foley said Thursday: \"While the market clearly latched onto the [rate cut] part of [Bailey's] statement, the inflation risks will remain key. Even when the potential impact of a Middle Eastern escalation is overlooked, U.K. inflation risks still suggest that the BoE could be slower to cut rates than several of its peers.\"  CNBC's Ganesh Rao contributed to this story."

        "header": "Japan still expected to stick to hiking cycle despite PM Ishiba's dovish turn",
        "content": "Despite dovish comments from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba leading to a sharp plunge in  the yen , market analysts aren't budging from their Bank of Japan policy expectations for the longer term. The yen slid to as weak as 147.15 against the  U.S. dollar  after Ishiba told reporters that the current economic climate does not require an additional rate increase. The currency  clocked its largest single-day decline since June 2022  during the session. \"I do not believe that we are in an environment that would require us to raise interest rates further,\" Ishiba said on Wednesday  after meeting with Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda   who leads the rate-setting committee at the bank. The prime minister's comments marked a drastic change in tone compared with the messaging on his recent campaign trail. \"This shift is particularly notable as the prime minister has been a long-time critic of past Liberal Democratic Party administrations, including the late Abe Shinzo's, whose 'Abenomics' was associated with monetary easing,\" said Stefan Angrick, senior economist at Moody's Analytics. \"My money is still on a rate hike in October,\" Angrick told CNBC,  noting that the latest BOJ meeting minutes from September   still held an optimistic view of the economy. The futures market on Thursday implied less than a 50% chance that the BOJ could hike by 10 basis points before the end of the year, according to LSEG data. On Thursday morning,  BOJ board member Asahi Noguchi said  that the central bank should continue its accommodative monetary policy for the time being. He noted that it will take a while to change the public's perception that prices will not increase significantly in the future. The Bank of Japan kept its benchmark interest rate steady at \"around 0.25%\"  the highest rate since 2008  in September. On July 31, Japan's central bank lifted its benchmark rate from its previous range of 0% to 0.1%. This came after the BOJ in March raised its policy rate for the first time in 17 years. While BOJ board members were split over the future path of interest rates at the September meeting, the board noted that Japan's economic activity and prices had been \"developing generally in line with the Bank's outlook.\" The BOJ is expected to next review interest rates on Oct. 30-31, when it will also provide updated quarterly forecasts for growth and prices. Another meeting is scheduled for December. Ken Matsumoto, macro strategist at Crdit Agricole CIB, said the markets were expecting the BOJ to raise the policy rate again at the upcoming October meeting with the economic and inflation outlook on track. But, he said, Ishiba's announcement Monday for a General Election due to held on Oct. 27 (which will decide which party is in control of the parliament's lower house) has thrown that off course. Matsumoto, meanwhile, added that he expects the BOJ to likely hike at the January meeting next year, not before.Mazen Issa, a fixed income strategist at MRB Partners, said his firm \"would not rule out another rate hike by the end of this year, but if not, the BOJ will hike by early 2025.\" \"We expect any further yen weakness will prove limited,\" he said. When the BOJ hiked rates previously in July, the move sparked the unwinding of the  popular yen carry trade , which led to a sharp sell-off in global markets. A \"carry trade\" takes place when an investor borrows in a currency with low interest rates, such as the yen, and reinvests the proceeds in a currency with a higher rate of return. Higher interest rates generally lead to a stronger yen, which can negatively impact Japanese stock markets, particularly those indexes dominated by exporters. A strong yen makes their exports less competitive in the global market. The BOJ and the government have been operating with greater coordination since the spring, and are now trying to encourage a consolidation in the currency following the great yen carry unwind, said Issa. \"Fundamental story still suggests that the BOJ is on track to hike into 2025, while the timing should depend on three factors,\" said Nomura's Yujiro Goto. A December rate hike by the BOJ is still possible  but only if the yen weakens further, the U.S. avoids a hard landing and the American economy remains stable even beyond the upcoming presidential elections in November, Goto told CNBC. Mizuho's executive economist, Kazuo Momma, echoed this view. What the BOJ will do largely depends on developments in exchange rates, which are materially influenced by developments in the U.S. \"If the yen stays stable or strengthens, the BOJ will probably wait at least until January 2025,\" he said."

        "header": "Swiss central bank cuts rates by a quarter point in third trim this year",
        "content": "The Swiss National Bank on Thursday took a third step to loosen monetary policy this year, bringing its key interest rate down by 25 basis points to 1.0%. The trim, which had been anticipated by 30 of 32 analysts surveyed in a Reuters poll, marked the SNB's third interest rate reduction of 2024. It was the first major Western central bank to reduce interest rates back in March. The third trim comes amid similar signals from the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which took the long-awaited plunge to slim down its interest rates with a 50-basis-point  cut last week . Domestically, Swiss inflation remains subdued, with the latest headline print pointing to a 1.1% annual increase  in August . Speaking to CNBC's Silvia Amaro on Thursday, SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan, who is leaving the central bank at the end of this month, acknowledged that \"further rate cuts may be necessary in order to stabilize inflation within the range of price stability in the next three months,\" but refused to be drawn on how many such policy easing interventions would be necessary. \"In December, the new inflation forecast will tell us exactly in what direction monetary policy should then be adjusted,\" he noted. The bank took its inflation forecast \"significantly lower\" than its June indications, citing the strength of the local currency, a weaker oil price and electricity price cuts announced for next January. The new outlook puts average annual inflation at 1.2% for 2024, 0.6% for 2025 and 0.7% for 2026, compared with 1.3%, 1.1% and 1.0% sketched out in June for the respective periods. The Swiss franc gained ground against major currencies on the back of the latest interest rate decision. The U.S. dollar and euro were down nearly 0.14% and 0.16% against the Swiss coin, respectively  meeting ING analysts'  expectations  that the cut would lead to \"outperformance\" of the Swiss currency. The strengthening of the Swiss currency in August prompted one of the country's largest associations, the technology manufacturers' group Swissmem to entreat the SNB to \"act soon, in line with its mandate\" and ease pressures constraining local businesses. \"This renewed exacerbation has come at a sensitive time for one of the key export industries: following a tough period of over a year, a slow recovery was in sight. If the upside pressure cannot be contained, these hopes will dissipate,\"  Swissmem said  at the time. The SNB acknowledged the broader trend of its currency rally as a key contributor to the Thursday reduction. \"Inflationary pressure in Switzerland has again decreased significantly compared to the previous quarter. Among other things, this decrease reflects the appreciation of the Swiss franc over the last three months,\" it said in a statement. \"The SNB's easing of monetary policy today takes the reduction in inflationary pressure into account. Further cuts in the SNB policy rate may become necessary in the coming quarters to ensure price stability over the medium term,\" it added. Some analysts have now raised questions whether Switzerland finds itself on the path of combating deflation  a rare sickness among major Western economies that have largely been afflicted with meteoric price rises since the Covid-19 pandemic. \"The SNB has consistently been behind the curve on its inflation forecasts this year, even as it has conditioned them on lower rates each time. The 0.6% forecast for 2025 is likely a bit too close for comfort for a central bank keen to return to deflation,\" said Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group. \"I expect another two 25bp moves in December and March at the very least, primarily because I don't see any near-term sources of depreciation for the franc without a stronger stance on intervention from the SNB. We are heading back towards zero relatively quickly,\" Chapman added. Jordan talked down this risk on Thursday. \"If you look at our inflation forecast, this is still within the range of price stability, so I cannot see any risk of deflation soon,\" Jordan told reporters, according to Reuters. He added that the central bank may nevertheless have to reduce rates again to retain inflation in the 0-2% target range. Adrian Prettejohn, Europe economist at Capital Economics, said that the SNB communique suggested that the central bank's policymakers have likely not used forex interventions \"to a significant extent\"  but may soon resort to such measures. \"We think the SNB will start to consider using FX interventions significantly once the policy rate falls to around 0.5%. At that point it will be a more finely balanced decision as to how much to rely on currency intervention rather than further rate cuts to provide further monetary policy support,\" Prettejohn said in a note. \"We are also very clear that we can use the foreign exchange intervention tool if necessary, and we will do that when we believe it's helpful for having an impact on monetary conditions,\" Jordan told CNBC's Amaro."

        "content": "Bank of Japan board members are split over the future path of interest rates,  minutes of the central bank's  monetary policy meeting in July showed. During the meeting, the board noted that Japan's economic activity and prices had been \"developing generally in line with the Bank's outlook.\" The  BOJ's July economic outlook  mentioned that the country's core inflation rate  which strips out prices of fresh food  would likely be around 2.5% for the 2024 fiscal year, and about 2% for the 2025 and 2026 fiscal year. Japan's fiscal year starts on April 1, so the 2024 fiscal year will end in March 2025. The central bank has set a 2% target for headline inflation. The board also pointed out that import prices had turned positive again, and upside risks to prices required attention. Some board members pointed out that \"it was appropriate for the Bank to make moderate adjustments\" given such risks. Rates should be gradually adjusted upward to prevent the risk of a situation where inflation exceeds the 2% target and rapid rate hikes are needed at a later time, one member said. Others appeared to disagree: \"Normalization of monetary policy must not be an end in itself,\" said a member, adding that future policy needed to be \"conducted carefully\" by monitoring the various risks associated with the bank's goal of normalizing its policy. Another member pointed out that medium-to long-term inflation expectations were not anchored at 2%, and prices remained vulnerable to downside risks. As such, the BOJ should avoid a situation where the market expectations for future rate hikes \"increase excessively.\" The BOJ raised its benchmark policy rate to \"around 0.25%\" in a 7-2 split decision in July, marking its highest interest rate since 2008. Board members Toyoaki Nakamura and Asahi Noguchi dissented, with both impressing on the need to study more economic and corporate data. At the July meeting, the bank had also outlined its plan to  reduce its purchases  of Japanese government bonds to about 3 trillion yen ($19.64 billion) per month in the January to March 2026 quarter. As of its March release, the bank said that purchases of JGBs amounted to about 6 trillion yen per month.  Shortly after the BOJ's decision on July 30, the yen strengthened for five straight days to hit its strongest level in eight months. The strength of the yen lead to the unwinding of the so called \"yen carry trade,\" putting pressure on equities. This, combined with recession fears from disappointing economic data out of the U.S. at that time, sent the Nikkei into a meltdown, with the index recording three straight days of losses from July 31, including a 12.4% loss on Aug. 5, its worst day since 1987."

        "header": "Fed Governor Bowman explains dissent on rate vote, says she's worried about inflation",
        "content": "Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday she thought her colleagues should have taken a more measured approach to last week's half percentage point interest rate cut as she worries that inflation could reignite. Bowman was the lone dissenter from the  Federal Open Market Committee's decision  to lower benchmark interest rates for the first time in more than four years. No governor had dissented from an interest rate decision since 2005. In explaining her rationale, Bowman said the half percentage point, or 50 basis point, reduction posed a number of risks to the Fed's twin goals of achieving low inflation and full employment. The jumbo cut \"could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term,\" she said in remarks to a bankers group in Kentucky. Inflation by the Fed's preferred metric is running at 2.5%, above the central bank's 2% goal. Excluding food and energy, core inflation is at 2.6%. Though Bowman favored a reduction, she preferred the Fed lower by a quarter percentage point, more in line with the traditional moves at the central bank. The FOMC last cut by half a point in the early days of the Covid pandemic in March 2020, and before that the global financial crisis in 2008. Bowman cited several specific concerns: that the big move would indicate that Fed officials see \"some fragility or greater downside risks to the economy\"; that markets might expect a series of large cuts; that large amounts of sideline cash could be put to work as rates fall, stoking inflation; and her general feeling that rates won't need to come down as much as her fellow policymakers have indicated. \"In light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market conditions,\" she said. In  recent statements , Fed officials have cited easing inflation and a softening labor market as justification for the cut. At last week's meeting, individual policymakers indicated they expect another half percentage point in reductions this year and another full point in 2025. Market pricing, however, is more aggressive, expecting 2 full percentage points in cuts through next year. The Fed's benchmark overnight borrowing rate is now targeted at 4.75%-5%. Bowman said she respects the committee's decision and emphasized that policy isn't on a preset course and will depend on the data, which she said has indicated the labor market has softened a bit but is still strong \"I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment,\" she said."

        "content": "Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said Monday that he expects policymakers to dial down the pace of interest rate cuts after last week's half percentage point reduction. \"I think after 50 basis points, we're still in a net tight position,\" Kashkari said in a CNBC \" Squawk Box \" interview. \"So I was comfortable taking a larger first step, and then as we go forward, I expect, on balance, we will probably take smaller steps unless the data changes materially.\" In a decision that came as at least a mild surprise, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday  voted to reduce its benchmark overnight borrowing rate  by half a percentage point, or 50 basis points. It was the first time the committee had cut by that much since the early days of the Covid pandemic, and, before that, the financial crisis in 2008. One basis point equals 0.01%. While the move was unusual from a historical perspective, Kashkari said he thought it was necessary to get rates to reflect  a recalibration of policy  from a focus on overheating inflation to more concern about a softening labor market. His comments indicate the central bank could move back to more traditional moves in quarter-point increments. \"Right now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we're on our way back to 2%,\" he said. \"So I don't think you're going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future,\" he said. As part of the committee's rotating schedule, Kashkari will not get a vote on the FOMC until 2026, though he does get a say during policy meetings. The rate cut Wednesday signaled that the Fed is on its way to normalizing rates and bringing them back to a \"neutral\" position that neither pushes nor restricts growth. In their latest economic projections, FOMC members indicated that rate is probably around 2.9%; the current fed funds rate is targeted between 4.75% and 5%. Other Fed officials, however, offered somewhat less cautious views than Kashkari. Speaking separately Monday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated he expects the Fed to move aggressively in getting back to a neutral rate. \"Progress on inflation and the cooling of the labor market have emerged much more quickly than I imagined at the beginning of the summer,\" said Bostic, who votes this year on the FOMC. \"In this moment, I envision normalizing monetary policy sooner than I thought would be appropriate even a few months ago.\" Bostic also noted that Wednesday's cut puts the Fed in a better position on policy, in that it can slow the pace of easing if inflation starts to peak up again, or accelerate it if the labor market slows further. Also, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he sees a continuous path of cutting, with rates coming down \"significantly,\" now that the risks to the Fed's dual mandate of low inflation and full employment are coming into better balance. \"As we've gained confidence that we are on the path back to 2%, it's appropriate to increase our focus on the other side of the Fed's mandate  to think about risks to employment, too, not just inflation,\" Goolsbee, an FOMC alternate this year and a voter in 2025. \"And given the through line on economic conditions, that likely means many more rate cuts over the next year.\" Market pricing anticipates a relatively even chance of the FOMC cutting by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a stronger likelihood of the larger move in December, for a total of 0.75 percentage point in further reductions by the end of the year, according to the CME Group's  FedWatch  measure."

His comments come as market participants  question  whether the U.S. central bank's jumbo rate cut has been delivered in time to bring down inflation without pushing the economy into recession. Some analysts have  raised concerns  about the outlook for the U.S. economy, warning that similar supersized rate cuts could not avert the recessions of the early 2000s and the global financial crisis. In a decision that came as a surprise to some economists, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday voted to reduce its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by half a percentage point, or 50 basis points, to a targeted rate of 4.75% to 5.00%.

Asked whether the Fed's rate cut may have secured a soft landing for the U.S. economy, Coleman said it was his hope and expectation that this would be the case. \"Right now, that is consensus,\" Coleman said. \"It's always a very tricky job to manage economies through transition. But you know, inflation levels are coming down, unemployment is manageable, they're starting to put through the rate cuts and sort of maintain a soft-landing trajectory.\" Not everyone is convinced that the U.S. economy will continue to hold up over the coming months. \"I'm a long-term optimist. Short term, I'm a little more skeptical than other people that everything's going to be great,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO  Jamie Dimon   said  in an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18 released Tuesday. \"Markets are pricing things like they're going to be great.

Citing recent data on consumer and producer prices, Waller told CNBC that the data is showing core inflation, excluding food and energy, in the Fed's preferred measure is running below 1.8% over the past four months. The Fed targets annual inflation at 2%. \"That is what put me back a bit to say, wow, inflation is softening much faster than I thought it was going to, and that is what put me over the edge to say, look, I think 50 [basis points] is the right thing to do,\" Waller said during an interview with CNBC's Steve Liesman. Both the consumer and producer price indexes showed increases of 0.2% for the month. On a 12-month basis, the CPI ran at a 2.5% rate. However, Waller said the more recent data has shown an even stronger trend lower, thus giving the Fed space to ease more as it shifts its focus to supporting the softening labor market. A week before the Fed meeting, markets were overwhelmingly pricing in a 25 basis point cut.

The Fed's action to  cut by half a percentage point,  or 50 basis points, brought its key borrowing rate down to a range between 4.75%-5%. Along with the decision, individual officials signaled the likelihood of another half point in cuts this year, followed by a full percentage point of reductions in 2025. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman was the only Federal Open Market Committee member to vote against the reduction, instead preferring a smaller quarter percentage point cut. She released a statement Friday explaining her opposition, which marked the first \"no\" vote by a governor since 2005. \"Although it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price stability mandate,\" Bowman said.

If the data starts coming in soft and continues to come in soft, I would be much more willing to be aggressive on rate cuts to get inflation closer to our target.\" The Fed gets another look at inflation data next week when the Commerce Department releases the August report on the personal consumption expenditures price index, the central bank's preferred measure. Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the Fed's economists expect the measure to show inflation running at a 2.2% annual pace. A year ago, it had been at 3.3%."

With the Fed recently cutting rates by a half point  and Chair Jerome Powell noting that two more quarter-point cuts could be in the cards this year  a new challenge awaits these active bond funds. \"Looking ahead, this nice juicy yield that people have enjoyed  it's not going to come down to zero, but it will be an interesting time for bond investors,\" said Jackson. A nimble approach Passive bond funds tend to have heavier weightings on Treasurys compared to their active counterparts, where you're more likely to see managers take some credit risk and exposure to bespoke bond holdings, Jackson said. \"That market is fragmented and there's more opportunity for mispricing,\" he added. \"With that, comes a better chance to exploit that mispricing and deliver returns.\" Another plus for active fund managers is the opportunity to exploit market developments. Consider that passive funds are required to buy certain securities to mimic the index they follow, which can result in spread compression for those assets, said Paul Olmsted, senior manager research analyst, fixed income, at Morningstar. \"[Active] managers can use that dynamic of the passive funds to avoid some of the securities that might be technically tight and go into the other parts of the market that might not be in the index and offer a little bit better relative value,\" he said. As interest rates fall, active managers can position accordingly, said Roger Hallam, global head of rates at Vanguard. \"If you were passive and didn't have the ability to vary your yield curve exposure, you wouldn't be able to benefit from the Fed' s attempt to cushion the economic landing,\" he said. In particular, Hallam highlighted the core and core-plus bond categories as offering investors a combination of attributes that fare well in challenging times but also provide yield. See below for a list of some of the top performing actively managed bond funds in the 12-month period ending June 30, per Morningstar's analysis. The Leader Capital Short-Term High Yield Bond Fund (LCCMX) returned of 21.87% in that period, benefiting from a roughly 94% allocation toward floating-rate instruments, and about 98% of its holdings have a duration of less than one year. Both factors fared well in a high interest rate environment and lifted LCCMX to the top of Morningstar's list among strongest performers in the period. The fund has a 30-day SEC yield that tops 10%, but its costs are also high: total annual fund operating expenses come in at 3.24%, according to LCCMX's prospectus. Shop with an eye toward quality and cost Morningstar found that even as actively managed intermediate core bond funds beat their passive counterparts, the most successful offerings were those with the lowest expenses. \"We expect active managers to make a little more, and they should be because they're doing more trades and it costs more to manage active portfolios,\" said Olmsted. \"Prices matter and they come off the [investor's] bottom line, so you have to look at it from that perspective, too.\" Investors should also get familiar with the asset classes that are driving a given fund's higher yields. A bond fund's income prospects may be attractive, but it's all for naught if it suffers in a downturn  and worse still, if it fails to offset the volatility an investor might see on the equities side of the portfolio. \"Be careful about risk, especially risk in lower grade credit,\" said Olmsted."

Rate-sensitive utilities are now the best-performing sector in the S & P 500 in 2024, jumping more than 28%. The sector is on pace for its best year since 2000, when it climbed more than 50%. Over the last three months, utilities have surged 19%, while tech is off more than 3% in the same period and the broad market index has gained nearly 3%. XLU XLK,.SPX YTD mountain Utilities versus tech and the S & P 500 in 2024 Utilities are viewed as an outsized beneficiary of lower borrowing costs due to their high capital requirements. Further, their high dividend yields make them more attractive to income-seeking investors when compared to Treasurys. While these stocks struggled in the high-rate backdrop of 2022 and 2023, they stand to outperform as rates decline. The sector has also emerged as a play on the burgeoning AI trend, as data centers are expected to fuel a demand for power in the coming years. However, there are indications the utilities trade may be getting too hot. The sector is now trading 20% above its 200-day moving average. The only other time this trend has occurred was for a single day in October 2000, according to SentimenTrader founder Jason Goepfert. Kathryn Rooney Vera, StoneX chief market strategist, said Thursday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that while utilities were her top pick coming into 2024, she is now looking elsewhere in the market for opportunities. \"What we're recommending is [to] take gains on utilities and rotate into another defensive that has outperformed this year and could do well next year  which is health care,\" she said. Analysts also think some of the top utilities could be due for a fall. Vistra Corp , the top-performing stock in the S & P 500 in 2024, is up more than 240% this year, but analysts' price targets imply downside of 5% from current levels, according to LSEG. Constellation Energy , which has surged 137% this year, is expected to slide 3% from current levels, per LSEG. For the time being, investors are still flocking to the names: Vistra and Constellation hit fresh all-time highs on Thursday."

        "content": "Beijing's rare stimulus blitz unleashed newfound optimism from hedge fund investors, who have been piling into beaten-down Chinese stocks like never before. Chinese equities saw the largest net buying ever from hedge funds last week, marking the most powerful weekly purchase on record, according to Goldman Sachs prime brokerage data. Hedge funds started flocking to Chinese stocks after the government announced a flood of stimulus measures in a bid to revive growth and avoid a deep slump in the world's second largest economy. The array of policy steps included interest rate cuts and reducing the amount of cash banks need to hold, known as the reserve requirement ratio. The excitement was underscored by David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, who told CNBC last week that he's buying \"everything\" related to China because of the latest government support. The high-profile investor even said he's raising his usual allocation limit and is not hedging his big China bet. \"I didn't know that they were going to bring out the big guns like they did,\" Tepper said. \"They kind of blew away expectations on the fiscal stimulus ... And I think there's a whole shift.\" Man Group, Burry It's not just Tepper who turned bullish on China. Man Group, the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund with $178 billion in assets under management, believes the central bank of China's moves could be a gamechanger. \"These policy reforms are expected to stimulate economic activity and improve investor sentiment, making China an attractive investment destination once again,\" Nick Wilcox, managing director of discretionary equities at Man Group, said in a note. Michael Burry, best known for calling the subprime mortgage crisis, may have anticipated such a policy move. He dove into Chinese internet stocks last quarter as Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, made Alibaba its top holding at the end of June. Chinese search engine Baidu and ecommerce platform JD.com were also big stakes in his portfolio. KWEB 5D mountain KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF Beijing's big stimulus also prompted BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, to upgrade Chinese stocks to overweight  with a caveat. \"Major fiscal stimulus may be coming and prompt investors to step in, given Chinese stocks are at a deep discount to developed markets shares,\" BlackRock strategists said in a note. \"Yet we stay ready to pivot. We are cautious long term given China's structural challenges.\" Still, rising trade concerns  including further tariffs between the U.S. and China  and geopolitical disputes centered on the South China Sea and the status of Taiwan, could once again spoil the party. Former hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, who now runs his personal fortune through a family office, reportedly said he's not interested in Chinese stocks under the current political leadership, regardless of the new policies."

        "content": "The rise and fall of the \"Nifty Fifty\" stocks in the 1970s is a cautionary tale for investors in the Magnificent Seven craze, according to BCA Research. The \"Nifty Fifty\" refers to a loose group of stocks including Coca-Cola , IBM , Xerox and Pfizer , that rose to prominence in the 1970 to 1973 bull market. BCA Research recently compiled a basket of 26 of these names and found that it generated annualized returns of 64% in that period before cratering 61% in the subsequent 1973-1974 bear market. \"The Magnificent Seven may not be the reincarnation of the Nifty Fifty, but investors can learn from past manias and panics,\" wrote Doug Peta, BCA's chief U.S. investment strategist, referring to the trend as a \"cautionary tale about groupthink.\" The comments from BCA come as the Magnificent Seven stocks continue powering the market to new heights despite a modest pullback this summer. The surge stems from ongoing bets around growth stocks and the artificial intelligence theme, especially as the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates. Nvidia has outpaced the group, surging 147% year to date. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia in 2024 There are plenty of differences between the Nifty Fifty and the Magnificent Seven, Peta said, including megacap tech names' longer track record of outperforming the market. While the 1970s phenomenon may not be an \"exact blueprint\" of what's to come, concerns have emerged, including elevated profit growth expectations and valuations reaching new heights, Peta said. This, combined with challenges around regulatory scrutiny and index weightings, could create a murky setup for these megacap tech mainstays, he added. \"Though we don't know if it fits the Magnificent Seven now or will at some later date, it most certainly applied in the early seventies, when too many investors became overly enamored with a small cadre of growth stocks and their future earnings prospects,\" Peta said. Given this setup and expectations for an \"imminent\" recession, the firm recommends a defensive investing stance. \"Independent of our take on the business cycle, however, the history of the Nifty Fifty suggests that investors may benefit from considering how long post-crisis investment leaders' outperformance will persist amidst major shifts in the monetary and fiscal policy backdrops,\" the strategist added."

        "header": "Nike stock chart is showing signs of a bottom and a turnaround ahead",
        "content": "The chart of Nike Inc. (NKE) had been forming a fairly constructive pattern of higher highs and higher lows since bottoming out around $70 in early August.While a disappointing earnings call this week caused a sudden gap lower for NKE, we could be setting up for the next leg higher as this long-term recovery story continues. Before this week's downside price gap, it's worth noting that Nike was testing a major resistance level into last week. The $90 price point represents a 38.2% retracement of the December 2023 to August 2024 downtrend, and also lines up fairly well with significant price lows in 2023 and 2024. To add to this \"confluence of resistance,\" we can also see the 200-day moving average looming large, currently sitting just above $91. For the bull case to continue from here, NKE would have to power through that resistance range and show upside follow-through into at least the mid-90's. This week's pullback brought Nike down to just above trendline support based on the August and September swing lows. So even though the gap lower was sudden and unfortunate, the price still remains within a well-formed uptrend phase. In terms of price momentum, the RSI is still holding above 40, which is more common in bull phases than bear phases. As long as the RSI remains above this 40 threshold in the coming days, I would be comfortable labeling this as a pullback within an established uptrend. The weekly chart can provide some additional context as to what the recent upswing means relative to the long-term trend for Nike. The long-term trend has been decidedly negative for NKE, with price remaining below the 150-week moving average since Q2 2022.Nike also sits below a downward-sloping 40-week moving average, which is essentially the same as the 200-day moving average on the daily chart. So while the long-term trend has been firmly negative, a recent bullish signal on the weekly PPO indicator suggests that this may be the beginning of a recovery phase. We have seen four such signals on the weekly chart of NKE since the COVID low in 2020, and in three of those four instances we've witnessed a strong rally in the following months. Recent bullish signals in 2022 and 2023 resulted in a retest of the 150-week moving average, which would imply upside for NKE to around $105 assuming a similar uptrend phase. So while the short-term gap lower this week for NKE certainly drives home the downside risk for this struggling footwear company, the long-term charts suggest this may just be the beginning of a more constructive trend. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

        "content": "As the fourth quarter gets underway, there are some stocks that may be poised to outperform over the next several months, according to Citi. September marked another positive month for stocks, with all three major averages finishing in the green, despite some tumultuous periods. The S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up more than 19% this year, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 11%. \"Now, broadening is apparent, with Value leading while Growth has not yet achieved July levels,\" Scott Chronert said in a Friday note to clients. The investment bank's head of U.S. equity strategy said expectations for a soft landing sentiment, tailwinds from AI investment and the upcoming presidential election could all serve as catalysts to move stocks higher. \"Importantly, an early theme related to '25 is earnings growth rate convergence,\" he said. \"In turn, while index level valuations appear full, we advocate shifting the focus to ongoing stock specific opportunities as we head into Q4.\" With this in mind, Citi updated its focus list for North America  a basket of bottom-up stock ideas with the highest conviction for the next 12 months. The firm added names such as Ally Financial , and removed others like Ideaya Biosciences and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals . Below are some names that made the list. Citi views newly added Ally Financial as \"one of the best-positioned liability sensitive names,\" seeing the potential for total book value growth of 25% by the fourth quarter of next year. \"While mistakes were clearly made with the '22 auto vintage, the short duration of this asset class implies ALLY will not be stuck with the problem beyond 2025,\" analyst Keith Horowitz wrote. \"[A]s that vintage continues to burn down, the improved '23 and '24 vintages will improve overall performance of the book.\" Horowitz expects Ally will update its outlook for credit losses when it reports its third-quarter results. If the outlook improves, he expects investors will reward the company with a higher valuation. As it stands, Wall Street is pretty split on the name, with 10 of the 21 analysts covering Ally having a strong buy or buy rating. Eight analysts have a neutral rating, while three rated Ally as underperform. Meanwhile, Citi has a buy rating on the stock, and its price target of $50 implies nearly 45% upside from Wednesday's close. This year, shares of Ally are marginally lower, down around 2%. Citi also named United Airlines as one of its top picks, saying any details about lower capital expenditures, a potential share repurchase or an uptick in card revenue could drive shares higher. The firm expects the domestic airline industry to see an uptick in unit revenue growth in the third quarter, with United benefiting from increased wallet share compared with pre-pandemic levels. Its target of $90 implies more than 61% upside, as of Wednesday's close, and shares are already up around 35% in 2024. \"Moreover, reduced capacity growth from competing discount airlines, along with consolidation among other carriers, helps create a more rational environment on which United and others can grow earnings,\" analyst Stephen Trent wrote. UAL YTD mountain UAL, year to date Citi's top pick in beverages, Coca-Cola , made the list. Analyst Filippo Falorni said the company has a \"stronger\" organic sales growth profile and he anticipates both third- and fourth-quarter earnings this year to come in higher than its peers. The bank's target of $85 implies more than 19% upside from Wednesday's close. The stock is up more than 20% year to date."

        "content": "Oil prices keep pushing higher as tensions build in the Middle East, and the moves in crude appear to be weighing on the stock market. Overlaying the charts of the United States Oil Fund LP (USO) and the S & P 500 in recent days shows that the fund and the index appear to be inversely correlated. In other words, when the oil fund climbs during the day, the stock market tends to dip, and vice versa. This is a change from rest of the year, when there appeared to be little relationship between the price of oil and the broad stock market. Through the first nine months of 2024, the correlation coefficient between the daily moves of the S & P 500 and USO was 0.1, according to a CNBC calculation. A correlation coefficient that's closer to 1 indicates a strong positive relationship between two variables, while one that's near -1 suggests an inverse relationship. A value of zero, however, indicates no correlation. In midday trading Thursday, U.S. crude oil prices were up 4% , and the USO had jumped roughly 3%. Meanwhile the S & P 500 was slightly lower. Of course, the relationship could be less about the oil price itself and more about investors worrying over the burgeoning conflict between Iran and Israel. Jeremiah Buckley, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said on CNBC's \" Squawk on the Street \" that the turmoil in that region of the world was a reason to be cautious. \"It's something we need to watch. In the short term, I don't think it's going to have a dramatic impact on markets, but certainly we need to watch what happens with energy prices and the flow of goods,\" Buckley said."

        "content": "Conagra Brands' stock fell sharply this week after the packaged-food company reported quarterly earnings that fell well short of analysts' expectations. We'll discuss how to play it with options if this company is caught in a longer-term decline. Known for brands like Birds Eye frozen vegetables, Hebrew National hot dogs, and Reddi-Wip, Conagra (CAG) 8% to $30.08. For the fiscal first quarter ending August 25, Conagra posted an adjusted eps of 53 cents a share, missing estimates. Revenues of $2.79 billion also fell short of estimates. However, the company did reaffirm fiscal 2025 guidance, projecting adjusted earnings per share between $2.60 and $2.65, in line with analysts' forecast. At first glance, Conagra's PE (price-earnings) ratio of just over 11.5 times FY estimates likely looks relatively cheap, less than half the forward multiple of the S & P 500. However, the most significant institutional options trades weren't betting on considerable upside. CAG YTD mountain Conagra, YTD Conagra traded eight times the average daily options volume, with puts outpacing calls. The two most active contracts were the January $30 puts and December $30 puts. It appears an institutional trader was purchasing the January $30 puts for an average of just over 1.41/contract and selling the December 30 puts at an average of just over 1.15 per contract or 26 cents net. At-the-money calendar spreads like this one are most profitable if the stock lands at the strike price on the expiration date. So is this, like Seinfeld, a \"show about nothing\"? Not precisely, because the longer-dated January options the institutional trader bought capture something other than Christmas and New Year's, the shorter-dated December options the trader sold do not: the following earnings report, which Conagra will release in the first week of January. Many retail traders are tempted to sell options that capture events such as earnings because the premiums are often elevated, but there's often good reason for that. If the company's headwinds persist, we'll find out in January. The packaged food business is a competitive one, and many consumers are feeling the pinch. The topline growth the company reported in recent years, mainly seen in quarters ended May, August, and November of 2020, was pandemic related (many stayed at home, as eating out declined, store-bought frozen and packaged food purchases shot up). Additionally, net income margins swung around significantly during 2020, exceeding 14% at one point, but the prior decade's operating results illustrate that the historical average was considerably lower, closer to 8%. So if we assume the company revenues do not grow YoY (flat at ~ $12 billion), and we pick a net income margin closer to the long-term pre-pandemic average of 8% rather than the 10-11% the Street is anticipating that gets us to closer to $2 in adjusted EPS. That would represent 15 times forward earnings (with little to no topline growth). This more pessimistic assessment may be prompting a few of the \"real money accounts\" (a group that includes mutual funds companies, pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth, etc.) to be net sellers according to their 13Fs this year. For example, T Rowe Price sold 6.7 million shares in Q2. American Century has sold almost 2.1 million shares per their most recent filing. The trade A dividend yield of 4.65% and a 15 PE is tempting, even if the company is a bit of a value trap, but challenging environments rarely evaporate quickly. Considering those things, I think the institutional trader's calendar put spread as a potential hedge against another bad quarter in January makes sense. One could consider using a diagonal, although with a lower strike longer-dated January $28 put and a higher $29 strike December because that would have no net outlay (in fact, during the trading day Wednesday, one would collect a credit for that trade). Trade example: Buy Jan. 17 $28 Put Sell Dec. 20 $29 put So the trade would be profitable on a modest decline and risks nothing if the shares should rally.

        "content": "This latest bull run has been strong, even by historical standards. The S & P 500 is up about 60% since hitting a bear market low in October 2022, boosted by easing inflation and excitement around artificial intelligence. The broad market index has also reached a record above 5,700  with some on the Street expecting it to top 6,000 before year-end. The bull market will be two later this month. If the current bull gain stands through Oct. 12, it would be the fourth-strongest among 13 cyclical bulls that lasted at least two years, according to Ned Davis Research. Ed Clissold, the firm's chief U.S. strategist, noted that bull markets \"don't die of old age.\" However, he pointed to three things for the gains to continue. .SPX mountain 2022-09-30 SPX since Q4 2022 The first: \"The disinflation that has defined the cyclical bull needs to remain in place,\" said Clissold. Inflation pressures are well off the levels seen in 2021. The consumer price index rose 2.5% in August on an annualized basis, nearing the Federal Reserve's 2% goal . The second element needed for the bull run to carry on is a successful soft landing. The Fed cut rates by a half percentage point last month, as it balances easing inflation and some wobbling in the labor market. As of right now, \"recession risks are low over the near term. Moderating growth should allow the Fed to continue to cut rates at a deliberate pace,\" Clissold said. Lastly, Clissold said earnings growth needs to stay strong. FactSet data shows analysts expect third-quarter S & P 500 earnings are expected to have grown 4.6% year over year. That would mark the benchmark's fifth straight quarter of profit expansion. Elsewhere on Wall Street this morning , JPMorgan upgraded EVgo to overweight from neutral, calling for nearly 80% upside. \"EVGO, which generates revenue on every kW of electricity dispensed to an EV driver, is expected to continue benefitting from higher utilization on every charger on its network, especially if competitor charging networks are unable to deploy chargers due to lack of demand,\" JPMorgan said."

The strategy is meant to minimize interest rate risks, explained Saraja Samant, a manager research analyst at Morningstar. \"When interest rates are going lower, even if the nearest rung matures and you're going to reinvest that at a lower rate, you have the maturity portion of your portfolio still locked in at now higher rates,\" she said. The strategy typically uses bonds or defined maturity exchange-traded funds , like Invesco's BulletShares and BlackRock's iBonds . Defined maturity ETFs provide diversity like traditional funds but have maturities and liquidate like a bond. Global X recently launched three ETFs that have a Treasury ladder within the fund. Its short-term Treasury ladder ETF focuses on securities maturing between one to three years, its intermediate-term fund aims for exposure on securities maturing between three and 10 years and its long-term ETF targets those maturing in 10 to 30 years. The funds each have total expense ratios of 0.12%. Global X believes this is the right time for these types of funds. \"By entering into a Treasury Ladder amidst a rate cutting cycle, investors gain exposure to falling rate tailwinds, while the equal-weighted ladder design allows investors to adopt a thoughtful stance on duration management in the face of potential interest rate volatility,\" said Robert Scrudato, director of options and income research at Global X . There aren't many ETFs that hold ladders currently on the market. Wisdom Tree has two Treasury ladder ETFs: a one- to three-year fund and a seven- to 10-year fund. Schwab has Treasury bond ladder strategies in separately managed accounts operated by its Wasmer Schroeder Strategies' team. BlackRock also appears to be looking to enter the space. The asset manager submitted filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission in August for new iShares ETFs that hold ladders in corporate bonds, high-yield securities and Treasurys. An ETF that holds a bond ladder could be a good move for someone looking to start a position or who has a smaller portfolio, said certified financial planner Barry Glassman, founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services in Vienna, Virginia. \"They get instant diversification into anywhere from a half dozen to a dozen bond maturities at once,\" he said. \"They can add to or take from the entire bond ladder all at once, which is challenging to do with an individual bond ladder.\" ETFs, however, are affected by investor cash flows in and out of the funds, Morningstar's Samant pointed out. The 'comfort' of a ladder To build a Treasury ladder, investors can go to Treasury Direct or use a broker dealer and tailor it to their needs, Samant said. Those buying corporate bonds may be better off building a ladder of defined maturity ETFs, since there is a lot of research and markups involved in buying individual corporate bonds, she added. Ladders are also transparent and give investors some comfort, said Michael Kessler, senior portfolio manager at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City. \"What we find is directly owning individual bonds in a ladder form, where they have a specific maturity date, that can help our clients achieve a greater level of comfort that they are going to get their principal back in the end,\" he said. It also helps investors think longer term than they typically would, Glassman said. \"It's psychology giving the permission to go out further than an investor would normally feel comfortable, especially with an inverted yield curve where short term is paying more than long term,\" he said. That said, not every corner of the bond market necessarily should be laddered, Kessler noted. His firm uses them for their short- to medium-term investment-grade corporate bond exposure. However, he's also added more exposure to mortgage-backed securities and securitized products, like AAA collateralized loan obligations, in his portfolios. For those assets, he uses ETFs, which give access to the market in a diversified, low cost way, he said."

Analysts overall are split on EVgo. LSEG data shows that, of the 12 analysts covering the stock, seven have a buy or strong buy rating, while the rest rate it as a hold."

Wall Street is coming off of an unusually strong September that saw stocks conclude the month with gains for the first time in five years. September is historically the worst month of the year for equities. A 50 basis point interest rate cut helped both the S & P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average push higher. However, an escalating conflict between Iran and Israel poured cold water on investor sentiment . The Middle East tensions are the latest headwind for jittery markets that are also watching developments with the economy and November election closely. \"From central bank policy shifts to elections, there is no shortage of uncertainty in among equity investors,\" said BofA strategist Anthony Cassamassino. Against this backdrop, Bank of America picked a handful of stocks that the firm thinks are poised for gains in the fourth quarter due to expected business and market developments. Here's a look at some of the names that made the list. Coffee giant Starbucks made the BofA list, with shares advancing 1.5% in 2024. The firm's $118 per share price target implies about 21% upside from Tuesday's $97.43 close.

She expects the former Chipotle chief to turn around Starbucks' North American business more quickly and with less investment than expected. SBUX YTD mountain Starbucks stock. Walmart stock has advanced more than 54% in 2024. Bank of America's $85 per share forecast calls for about 5% upside ahead. Analyst Robert Ohmes said Walmart's efforts to improve its e-commerce business with faster delivery options, store renovations and the growth of its membership service Walmart+ could help push the stock, especially during the key holiday shopping season. WMT YTD mountain Walmart stock. \"We think a shortened selling season (5 fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas vs. last year) will likely lead to higher online spend, favoring large digital/omni-channel players like WMT that offer a broad range of fast/convenient fulfillment options,\" Ohmes said.

        "header": "India has emerged as one of the best global markets for the long haul. Here are the drivers\u2014and how to play the rally",
        "content": "India's recent stock market surge has investors viewing the country as an emerging market poised for long-term outperformance. The India NSE Nifty 50 Index , the country's domestic stock market benchmark, has soared 18.7% this year, hitting record levels. The iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA) , which tracks the Indian market, is also up nearly 19% in 2024. That would be the fund's biggest annual gain since 2017  when it jumped 34.5%. It's also outperforming the broader iShares MSCI Emerging Market ETF's (EEM) 16% gain. Several elements drive the India bull market case, including an increasingly tech-savvy banking system, public infrastructure investments and supply chain diversification out of China. On top of that, consumer spending and real estate investments are growing. \"India is the best structural story in emerging markets, by far, but potentially in the world at this point,\" Malcolm Dorson, head of emerging markets strategy at Global X ETFs told CNBC. \"The data show that, historically, the Indian market has offered robust returns with reduced volatility.\" .NSEI YTD mountain Nifty 50 performance this year. The Fed effect Indian equities become even more attractive when accounting for lower U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates, Dorson noted. The Fed last month cut rates by a half percentage point, and traders see further reductions before year-end. Historically, Indian equities move up 3.73% for every 1% decline on the U.S. dollar versus the Indian rupee, according to Global X. (Lower rates tend to put downward pressure on the dollar.) GlobalX also pointed to data highlighting that the MSCI India index averages a more than 27% gain in the six months after the Fed concludes a rate cutting cycle, outperforming other major benchmarks from around the world. Going out 12 months, that increase grows to 38%, based on data going back to 2000. \"India does not only better than traditional U.S. asset classes  the S & P 500 , the Nasdaq , the Russell 2000  but does even better than emerging markets ... it's an amazing compounding story right now,\" Dorson said. India overtakes China What's more, India  which remains the world's fastest growing major economy  has also moved past China to become the largest emerging market. This year, India overtook China in the MSCI All-Country World Index by country weight. Investors tend to like India's position against China given its higher earnings growth. Dorson expects India to see roughly 6% to 8% earnings growth a year for the next five years, with that high growth being reinvested into profitable projects, he said. They also view India as a defensive play given its friendlier relationship with international governments and its status as the world's largest democracy. The latter makes India more likely to attract foreign investment and be sheltered from global trade war risks. India has also outperformed the broader emerging markets in recent years. Over the past five years, the INDA fund has soared 77.2%, while EEM is up just 16%. Going back to 2015, INDA has seen bigger annual gains and smaller declines than the broader emerging market fund. MRB Partners emerging markets strategist Amr Abdel Khalek is similarly bullish on India's growth. \"People need to pay a lot more attention to [India], because it's going to be increasingly a source of demand for the rest of the world, with the young population and people moving from lower class to middle class. So there's a lot of potential there,\" Khalek told CNBC. He recommends staying overweight on EM stocks within a global equity portfolio, with a preference for non-China exposure. The risks To be sure, investing in India doesn't come risk-free. A headwind for this stock market could come from the U.S., if the Fed cuts rates less than anticipated. Traders anticipate more reductions before year-end, per the CME Group's FedWatch tool. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank may implement smaller rate reductions ahead . Additionally, India faces an income inequality crisis. Barclays analyst Venugopal Garre noted that while the middle class is at a new growth stage, the top 10% of India's population control nearly 50% of the country's national income. \"The risk is that employment opportunities fail to shape up as desired, and India's economic progress is derailed by changes in the domestic political environment and geopolitics in general,\" he said in an early September note. How to play the Indian market Financials are among investors' favorite spots in India's booming stock market. Krishna Mohanraj, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management, called out the country's banks as an attractive space. \"You've got three things going on: GDP growth, overall banking system growth and private sector banks growing outsized versus a public sector bank. So you put all those three together over the next decade, it seems like a great place to be in,\" Mohanraj told CNBC. \"And banking valuations are more reasonable than industrials or consumer valuations, so you get the valuation advantage as well.\" Both Global X's Dorson and Mohanraj named HDFC Bank , ICICI Bank and Axis Bank among their top picks in the Indian financial sector. U.S. investors can buy ADRs for ICICI and HDFC. Axis bank is only available over the counter, however. Dorson said Indian financials are undervalued. These three banks are \"high-quality names\" that have invested heavily into their technology over the past few years, he said. Growing online banking businesses can also help these bank save on cost by shrinking their physical footprints. Dorson and Mohanraj also like stocks tied to India's domestic infrastructure push, but think some areas of Indian industrials are currently too expensive. \"India has been investing aggressively in infrastructure. I don't see any signs of that slowing,\" Mohanraj said. He named an Australian coal mining name, Whitehaven Coal , as a potential beneficiary of this trend as the company supplies metallurgical coal to the Indian steel industry. India's economic growth and infrastructure development have also made real estate an attractive spot for foreign investment . Along with the continued rapid development of office spaces, the industry's also benefitting from consumers' increased disposable income and desire for larger homes. Within real estate, Dorson likes Prestige Estates Projects . The stock, along with Whitehaven Coal, is available to U.S. investors through over-the-counter shares."

        "content": "The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) was the worst performing sector ETF in September. This is nothing new, as it's also the worst performing sector year-to-date (up just 7.8%).Those two bearish stats alone are enough to cause many investors to look elsewhere for potential trades. Indeed, buying stocks and ETFs that have been breaking out to new highs has been rewarded often in 2024. Case in point, of the top 20 stocks in the S & P 500 this year, only one of them currently is more than 3% below its 52-week high (Nvidia). Conversely, 14 of 22 energy names are more than 10% below their respective 52-week highs. Indeed, looking for relative strength by scanning the new high list has worked well, but ignoring the rest of the market could cause us to miss potential opportunities elsewhere. The XLE ETF (and many of its holdings) has been trying to etch out a bottom for a number of weeks, and the charts we're reviewing today suggest that momentum finally could be turning positive. Testing the trendline Let's first look at this daily chart. XLE has been making lower lows and lower highs since peaking in March. It's made a few solid attempts at breaking the pictured trendline, but each effort has been prematurely snuffed out. Thus, XLE's downtrend has persisted. We've seen this before. In fact, two other downtrends pictured here look extremely similar to the current one. Both prior times, eventually logging a higher low gave XLE the firepower it needed to finally punch through a key downtrend line. XLE then extended both breakouts for multiple months . XLE, again, now has formed a necessary higher low. The strong start this week has put XLE right at the line. The next step, of course, would be puncturing the line. Once that happens, it will be important to watch how its 14-day RSI reacts. If the indicator finally can extend beyond the mid-range near 50, it would tell us that momentum is confirming the move. That happened during the past two rallies, as well. Multi-year uptrend Considering the erratic movement since 2023, it feels like XLE has been stuck in one big trading range. That's true but zooming out shows us a much different picture. XLE actually has been making higher lows ever since bottoming at the COVID lows in 2020. Recently, the higher lows have been marginal, but considering that we haven't seen a material lower low in nearly five years, it's noteworthy. Said differently, buying weakness in an uptrend has been rewarded eight prior times. Thus, if it were to work again this time, it wouldn't be anything new. That increases our conviction in wanting to buy XLE. Impending two-decade breakout The (very) big picture shows us just how significant the next rally could be for XLE. Despite finishing lower in September, XLE bounced 5% from its monthly low. That low point was near the trendline that is part of this potential three-year ascending triangle pattern. The ETF tried to break out from this same pattern this past spring, but that effort ultimately failed. We can see why  the area between $90 and $100 houses its last two all-time highs from May 2008 and June 2014. If/when XLE can make it through that range, it will start popping up on screens that are searching for breakouts to new highs. Given the shorter-term setup discussed above, we're now aware of how that could happen and how significant it would be. -Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) is positioning itself as a leader in AI technology, not only with its recent open-source large language models (LLM) advancements but also by integrating AI into its existing suite of products. While companies like OpenAI have traditionally led in AI innovation, Meta's LLaMA 2 models have gained significant attention, and they are proving to perform on par, if not better, in certain benchmarks. The strategic focus Meta has placed on monetizing these AI tools across its platforms  including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp  gives it a unique competitive advantage. This commitment to revenue generation from AI sets it apart from other firms still exploring AI potential without clear paths to monetization. If we review the chart for Meta, it has shown strong performance, recently breaking above a key resistance level at $545. Additionally, the relative outperformance against the S & P 500 , confirms the breakout to new all-time highs. With continued positive momentum and strong support, Meta looks poised for further upside, especially as it capitalizes on AI innovation and integration. Meanwhile, the company boasts robust growth projections with an expected future EPS growth of 22% (industry average of 16%) and a revenue growth rate of 15% (industry average of 11%). What sets Meta further apart is its exceptional profitability, with industry leading net margin of 34%, compared to the industry average of 24%. With these growth and profitability metrics, Meta appears undervalued, offering a compelling risk/reward profile for long-term investors looking to benefit from its AI-driven revenue potential. To capitalize on Meta's continued upside potential while limiting risk, consider selling a Nov 15 $575/530 put vertical spread at a $16.87 Credit. This entails: Selling the Nov 15, 2024 $575 Put for $31.45 Buying the Nov 15, 2024 $530 Put for $14.58 View this link in OptionsPlay with updated pricing. This trade allows you to profit if Meta remains above $575 by expiration. The maximum potential reward is $1,687, with a maximum risk of $2,813, offering a solid risk/reward profile. The breakeven point on this trade is $558.13, meaning you will only start incurring losses if Meta closes below this level by expiration.

        "content": "Dell Technologies will continue to see outsized benefit from growing demand for artificial intelligence data centers, according to Goldman Sachs. The firm reiterated a buy rating on the personal computing and technology stock on Wednesday, with a $155 per share price target. Goldman's forecast implies roughly 37% upside ahead for Dell stock from its $113.16 close on Tuesday. Dell stock has surged more than 51% in 2024. After vising the company's Texas headquarters and meeting with executives, analyst Michael Ng says the firm came away from the discussions optimistic that the growing demand for artificial intelligence data centers will help boost Dell stock. Ng says Dell will specifically see benefits due to higher demand from tier 2 cloud and AI CSP [constraint satisfaction problems] servers, as well as enterprise/sovereign customers. In particular, Ng pointed to Dell's $3.8 billion AI server backlog in the second-quarter as a prime example of robust demand. Over the long-term, the analyst says both enterprise and sovereign customers will emerge as the key drivers as margins improve for AI servers. \"Enterprise and sovereign AI opportunities are in earlier stages of adoption, and the company continues to optimize its organization to address AI demand across customer verticals and regions,\" Ng said. \"AI server margins should improve over time through a greater mix of higher margin services revenue and a diversification to a larger number of AI server customers.\" The analyst also says renewed demand for PC's could also help the stock moving forward, and pointed out that a large portion of the company's installed-base comprises hardware that isn't powerful enough to run Windows 11. This dynamic could spur a strong upgrade cycle, he says. \"DELL is optimistic about an industry PC refresh cycle despite a slower-than-expected recovery relative to the beginning of the year with demand likely to be driven by the aging PC installed base, Windows 10 end-of-life in October 2025, and AI PCs,\" Ng said. \"Of the approximately 1.5 [billion] installed base of PCs, about 400-450 [million] PCs are on Windows 10, of which 200-250 [million] likely are on hardware that does not meet minimum requirements for Windows 11.\""

Recursion was able to use its artificial intelligence-enabled drug discovery platform to identify an area of biology to target for the treatment of solid tumors and lymphoma, match it with a drug candidate and move all the way to gaining regulatory approval to begin studies in less than 18 months. \"We think that's a really exciting proof point, not only for us as a company, but I think for the techbio industry as well,\" said CEO and co-founder Chris Gibson, in an interview with CNBC. The Food and Drug Administration cleared the investigational new drug application for a phase 1/2 clinical trial of an experimental drug candidate known as REC-1245. The company said the potential market for this treatment could be more than 100,000 patients in the U.S. and European Union. The trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of REC-1245 and will begin in the fourth quarter of this year. The phase 1 data from the dose-escalation portion of the study could be completed by the end of next year, the company has said. The drug will target RBM39, which Recursion said appears functionally similar to a well-known but hard to target marker known as CDK12 to treat advanced biomarker-enriched cancers such as ovarian, prostate, breast and pancreatic cancers. \"I think what's really exciting about this particular program of Recursion is that this small molecule and novel target came out from essentially a Google-search equivalent, from this giant map of biology that we've already built,\" Gibson said, referring to the massive datasets that Recursion has created over the past 11 years. \"This is the first program that's come of that,\" he continued. \"It's the first program that really is leveraging many of these new tools that we've built in one unit.\" There is much hope that artificial intelligence will be able to significantly speed up drug discovery and make it less costly by eliminating some of the time-consuming trial-and-error as drug candidates are screened and selected. But  investors have been wanting to see that the reality  can live up to the hype. Recursion, which counts Nvidia among its investors, has seen its shares fall 38% in 2024. But the stock is still more than 60% below a 52-week high it hit in late February. The company is planning to merge with fellow AI-drug discovery company  Exscientia , which will allow it to harness even more data. The deal is expected to close early next year. The majority of analysts rate Recursion shares a hold, but two analysts do have a buy rating on the stock, according to FactSet. The average analyst price target of $10.14, implies a 64% return."

That's the highest quarterly value sold by employees and directors of companies in the semiconductor industry, the Washington Service said, and includes pre-planned sales. Chip insiders have stepped up their sales of company stock this year as AI-driven demand for processing power has propelled the sector's outperformance. Nvidia (NVDA) is the second-best performing stock in the S & P 500 so far in 2024, up more than 137% since December 2023.

Nvidia board member and venture capitalist Tench Coxe too sold 2 million shares in late September for a total around $235.7 million.

Against this backdrop, JPMorgan has refreshed its top ideas list targeting growth, income, value and short selling strategies. The investment bank added six stocks and removed seven from last month. For October, the additions include Best Buy and Carmax , while Wayfair , CarGurus and First Citizens BancShares are among those removed. Below are some of JPMorgan's picks for October. JPMorgan added Best Buy to its focus list on Friday as one of the firm's value strategies, seeing a possible inflection point in the electronics retailer's key categories, such as TVs and appliances. The bank cited positive existing home sales, and an expansion in AI adoption, believing Best Buy will see continued growth in average selling prices . Analyst Christopher Horvers says Best Buy will increase its profitability over time, noting an uptick in operating margins to 5% from last year's 4.1%. He has an overweight rating on the stock, and his price target of $111 implies more than 9% upside from Tuesday's close. \"We believe BBY sits in investors' blind spot with replacement demand rising in 2025 given further time from the start of Covid, new computing technology in its early stages and the sensitivity of TVs/appliances to housing turnover,\" the analyst wrote in a note to clients. \"We also note that vendors need BBY, an important endorsement for quality investors looking for higher beta names with cyclical upside.\" By contrast, 16 of the 28 analysts on Wall Street who are covering the stock are neutral, while 11 have a buy-equivalent rating. Analysts' average price target on Best Buy stands at $104, implying just 3% upside. Year to date, Richland, Minnesota-based Best Buy has already surged more than 29%. AT & T also made JPMorgan's focus list as another part of the bank's value strategy. JPMorgan rates AT & T overweight, with a price target of $24, about 8% above Tuesday's close. The Street is also bullish on Dallas-based AT & T, which sports a dividend yield a little more than 5%, with 16 of 29 analysts having a strong buy or buy rating, but their average price target implies roughly 2% downside. This week, shares of AT & T were marginally higher after the telecommunications company agreed Monday to sell its 70% stake in DirectTV to private equity firm TPG for $7.9 billion. The stock has jumped nearly 32% this year, not including the dividend. On the growth side, JPMorgan listed Eli Lilly as one of its picks. The bank's target of $1,100 implies more than 24% upside, and the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound diabetes and weight loss drugs is up more than 51% in 2024. LLY YTD mountain LLY, year to date The Street is largely bullish on Lilly. The consensus price target of $1,003 would represent more than 13% upside. Twenty three out of 28 analysts covering Lilly give it a buy-equivalent rating. JPMorgan's recommendation comes as Lilly said it in September it would invest $1.8 billion to expand manufacturing in Ireland for its Alzheimer's , obesity and diabetes drugs, as well as other treatments. Other stocks that JPMorgan's recommended for October, such as Charles Schwab and Ulta Beauty , were similarly on the bank's focus list highlighting growth strategies. The bank's price target for Schwab implied about 22% upside and for Ulta Beauty about 18% potential appreciation, based on Tuesday's close."

        "content": "(This is a wrap-up of the key money moving discussions on CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange\" exclusive for Pro subscribers. Worldwide Exchange airs at 5 a.m. ET each day.) Investors are trying to digest the market risk in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. One policy expert says the Middle East, along with Ukraine and the tensions in the South China Sea, are forming the biggest overall geopolitical risk for investors in the past 50 years. Worldwide Exchange Word of the Day: Income Simeon Hyman of Proshares Advisors said with rising geopolitical tension, a U.S. port strike and a potential market moving jobs report coming up on Friday, investors should turn to bonds for guaranteed income. \"The fixed income market has enough yield to bail you out if the geopolitical tensions get worse,\" said Hyman said on Worldwide Exchange. Geopolitical risk Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy said investors are seeing the riskiest geopolitical environment in the past 50 years and it could be dangerous to ignore it. Haines says the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, the Ukraine War and tensions in the South China Sea have not been fully priced into the market. \"The worst possibly happening has markedly increased in just the past few weeks,\" Haines said. \"Investors are not focusing on the likely U.S. response post election to replenishing defense stocks and ramping up capabilities.\" Defense stocks Lockheed Martin (LMT) , Raytheon (RTX) and L3Harris (LHX) are all higher on the week on Middle East tensions between Israel and Iran. Worldwide Exchange Pick: Biotech Stocks Scott Ladner of Horizon Investments is seeing opportunities in the biotech sector, specifically the iShares Biotechnology ETF (IBB) and SPDR S & P Biotech (XBI) ETFs. For now, he sees the sector as another way to bet on artificial intelligence innovation, but is watching the economy closely. Both ETFs have traded lower since the Fed's half-point cut, and Ladner believes another aggressive cut would actually be a negative for the rate sensitive sector. \"The reason I like biotech and healthcare has more to do with AI,\" said Ladner on Worldwide Exchange, \"It matters why we get to 50 (basis point cut) if we get there because the economy is too slow and too weak, that is probably a problem.\" Chart of the Day: Shipping Stocks Shipping stocks have actually outperformed amid the disruption at U.S. East and Gulf Coast ports as the Longshoremen's strike enters its second day. Investors appear to be betting these companies will benefit from the disruption of normal supply routes and be able to charge higher rates as retailers look to move merchandise in other ways."

        "content": "(This is CNBC Pro's live coverage of Wednesday's analyst calls and Wall Street chatter. Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) An apparel giant and a motorcycle maker were among the stocks being talked about by analysts on Wednesday. Baird downgraded Harley-Davidson to neutral from buy. Meanwhile, several analysts on the Street reacted to Nike's latest quarterly figures. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 7:36 a.m.: Raymond James downgrades T-Mobile after strong outperformance Raymond James no longer sees significant and immediate upside for T-Mobile , downgrading the stock to outperform from strong buy. The firm's thesis played out, with the wireless carrier enjoying rapid free-cash-flow expansion of more than four times from 2020 to 2023, analyst Ric Prentiss wrote in a note. The stock is also up more than 75% since the end of 2021, he said. Prentiss still expects steady, long-term returns and raised his price target to $221 from $208, suggesting 7% upside from Tuesday's close. \"With the very successful Sprint merger fully complete, T-Mobile remains the fastest growing in the mature wireless industry, and we think it trades at a justified premium, but further multiple expansion is likely to be limited,\" he said. Shares are up nearly 29% year to date.  Michelle Fox 7:23 a.m.: Rio Tinto stands out among its mining peers, says Berenberg The firm upgraded shares to buy and lifted its price target to $79 from $71, suggesting 11% upside from Tuesday's close price. Rio Tinto's acquisition of aluminum company Alcan in 2007 has been widely perceived as \"one of the worst deals done in the mining sector in terms of value destruction\" per analyst Richard Hatch. However, he thinks the company's struggles was simply a victim of poor timing with the global financial crisis in 2008 and a ramp-up of aluminum production in China and slowdown of China's economy in the 2010s. Following a site visit to the company's aluminum operations, the analyst believes the outlook on the aluminum asset looks attractive. Hatch added Rio Tinto is \"what an economic moat really looks like.\" The revival of China's economy through its recently-announced aggressive stimulus measures have sent iron ore prices higher, a key segment for Rio Tinto. \"We also think that this underpins cost curve support of Rio's key commodities, such as iron ore. With a lower medium-term capital bill than BHP, and significantly less execution risk than Anglo American, we move Rio up to Buy, and think that the shares will be the medium-term diversified winner versus peers,\" Hatch wrote in a Tuesday note. Hakyung Kim 6:54 a.m.: Raymond James steps to the sidelines on GE Vernova Clean energy company GE Vernova may be becoming too crowded of a trade, according to Raymond James. Analyst Pavel Molchanov downgraded shares to market perform from market perform in a Wednesday note. The stock has soared 94% since it spun off from General Electric in April. As a result, Molchanov believes GE Vernova's rally, fueled by power demand from the AI rally, is becoming overstretched. \"Everything has its price, and at this point we are of the view that this rally feels a bit overstretched,\" Molchanov said. The company is currently trading at 46 times its 2025 forecasted adjusted earnings per share, which is expensive relative to its specialty industrial peers, the analyst added. \"The bottom line is that we think the stock could use a period of consolidation after its sentiment- driven gains, and we look forward to revisiting our rating if and when the trade becomes less crowded,\" said Molchanov.  Hakyung Kim 6:43 a.m.: Barclays upgrades Diamondback Energy Diamondback Energy shares are attractive, says Barclays. The firm upgraded the oil stock to overweight from equal weight. It adjusted its price target to $210 from $216. \"We believe FANG has one of the clearest positive event paths in our coverage universe in the coming quarters as the company fully integrates Endeavor,\" analyst Betty Jiang wrote in a Wednesday note. The analyst referred to Diamondback Energy's $26 billion merger agreement with Endeavor Energy Resources announced earlier this year. Jiang expects Diamondback Energy's 2025 oil production to come in 6% above consensus expectations while releasing a more capital efficient program. \"Management recently highlighted in-basin gas generation, which we believe would be a way for FANG to further reduce operating costs,\" Jiang added. The stock advanced more than 3% Wednesday before the bell. Year to date, it's up more than 14%.  Hakyung Kim 6:28 a.m.: Evercore ISI upgrades M & T Bank M & T Bank could see more upsides ahead as the Federal Reserve continues to lower interest rates, according to Evercore ISI. The firm upgraded shares to outperform from in-line. It also raised its price target to $210 from $187, suggesting shares could rise more than 17% from Tuesday's close. Analyst John Pancari cited improving fundamentals and capital return as upside drivers of the stock. The recent Fed rate cut and soft-landing likelihood has already helped the stock outperform in recent months, he noted. Shares are up 26% in 2024. MTB YTD mountain MTB year to date \"We see further outperformance as a favorable inflection in MTB's fundamentals could support a more constructive earnings outlook. We also believe MTB's earnings could prove more resilient than expected, helped by fixed asset repricing, funding flexibility, and EA upside,\" Pancari said in a research note on Wednesday. Lower rates will also benefit the company's commercial real estate-related loan balances, he added.  Hakyung Kim 5:58 a.m.: JPMorgan downgrades MercadoLibre JPMorgan is stepping to the sidelines on Latin American e-commerce company MercadoLibre . Analyst Marcelo Santos downgraded shares to neutral from overweight. He maintained his $2,400 price target, which implies 16.2% upside potential from Tuesday's close. Santos sees limited gains ahead for the stock, which has already rallied 31.5% in 2024. \"On one side, the company has a very promising [long-term] outlook with LatAm e-commerce still being very underpenetrated,\" Santo wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"On the other side, MELI is still in an investment phase, and is unlikely to meet or beat consensus estimates given increasing expenses with logistics and the ramp- up of the credit card business, which carries a structurally lower margin,\" the analyst added. Foreign exchange losses are another short-term headwind for the stock, Santos noted.  Hakyung Kim 5:46 a.m.: Nike is 'getting back in shape,' say analysts Nike's fiscal first-quarter results show promising signs of a new chapter for the struggling athletic wear company, according to analysts. The company posted mixed quarterly results. Although its earnings per share of 70 cents topped an LSEG consensus estimate of 52 cents per share, its revenue of $11.59 billion fell short of the $11.65 billion forecast. Nike is gearing up for new CEO Elliott Hill to take over on Oct. 14. As a result, it withdrew its guidance for the full year and pushed off its investor day. Shares slipped 5% Wednesday premarket. NKE 5D mountain NKE falls Nonetheless, some analysts on Wall Street are optimistic. Bank of America's Lorraine Hutchinson reiterated her buy rating while trimming her price target to $100 from $104. The \"next chapter begins with a clean slate,\" Hutchinson wrote in a Wednesday note. \"We think the fundamental reset ahead of Hill taking over as CEO later this note tempers the risk of a sales miss and gives Hill the flexibility to implement his strategy.\" She cited early indications of success in its running segment as another tailwind. Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai also maintained her buy rating and inched down her price target by $3 to $92. Nike is \"getting back in shape  one step at a time,\" Katai said in a research note on Thursday. \"NKE's 1Q print reinforced our view that the turnaround will be a marathon, not a sprint,\" Katai wrote. \"This is why we are optimistic about incoming CEO Elliott Hill. He brings back much-needed institutional knowledge.  We expect a renewed focus on product, both in core and specialty running, and greater engagement with consumers as NKE rebuilds its wholesale relationships.\" Meanwhile, JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss remained on the sidelines with his neutral rating. He believes the difficult macro environment globally complicates Nike's recovery story and highlighted elevated marketplace inventories that will require greater-than-expected promotional activity. Boss lowered his price target to $77 from $80.  Hakyung Kim 5:46 a.m.: Baird downgrades Harley-Davidson to neutral Don't expect a major breakout from Harley-Davidson anytime soon, according to Baird. Analyst Craig Kennison downgraded the motorcycle maker to neutral from buy. He also lowered his price target on shares to $40 from $42, implying upside of just 5.2% over the next 12 months. \"We contacted Harley-Davidson dealers for an update on Q3 trends. Dealers reported weak retail, excess inventory, and caustic sentiment  all of which suggest risk to guidance,\" Kennison wrote. \"Dealer frustration is boiling over, a dynamic that may force change. We see value in the brand, but it is best to sit this ride out as pressure builds from riders, dealers, and shareholders.\" Harley-Davidson shares are up just 3.2% year to date.

        "header": "This is the key group of stocks to watch if the port strike drags on this month",
        "content": "A look back in history shows how a key group of transportation stocks performed the last time there was a major port strike, according to Wolfe Research. On Tuesday, 50,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), the largest longshoremen's union in North America, went on strike at 14 major ports along the Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Seaboard, affecting billions of dollars in trade as well as roughly half of all U.S. trade activity. The walkout came after failing to reach an agreement on a new contract over wage increases and automation. For investors, the effect of the strike depends on how long it lasts, Wolfe said. But with President Joe Biden, who has the power to order strikers back to work using an 80-day cooling off period under the Taft-Hartley Act, unlikely to act soon, Wolfe said many of its business contacts are preparing for the stoppages to continue for the next two- to three weeks. Against that backdrop, Scott Group, a senior analyst covering freight transportation at Wolfe, looked at transportation stocks in 2002, the last time there was a major port strike in the U.S. That strike, which lasted just 11 days and affected only West Coast ports, hurt transportation stocks throughout the protest, he said. But those same stocks staged a major comeback in the month after the strike ended. Here are how some key stocks performed during and after the last major strike. C.H. Robinson Worldwide was among the biggest laggards during the last port strike. The freight transport company slid more than 5% during the walkout, but rebounded strongly after, surging more than 16%. The stock is a consensus hold on the Street, according to CNBC's analyst consensus tool. Shares are up 27% already this year. However, Evercore ISI over the summer upgraded C.H. Robinson to outperform from in line, saying the outlook was more favorable. Shares were last down slightly, by about 0.6%. J.B. Hunt Transport Services dipped more than 7% during the last strike, but soared 25% afterward. It's already down more than 14% this year. On Tuesday, it was off by about 1.6%. FedEx and Norfolk Southern also bounced back in the wake of the last strike, after initially falling."

        "header": "Yields on cash are cooling. Here are a few alternatives for your short-term dollars",
        "content": "It's only been two weeks since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years, but investors are already getting paid less to park their extra cash. Central bank policymakers trimmed a half point from the fed funds rate in September, bringing it down to a range of 4.75% to 5%. Two more cuts, totaling another half point, could be in the cards by the end of the year, provided the economy performs as expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday . That means that the days of 5% yields on idle cash are largely in the past, at least for the current cycle. The Crane 100 Money Fund Index had an annual 7-day yield of 5.1% at the end of August, and just over a month later it's fallen to 4.75%. \"The market is telling you that it's not just the fed funds rate [that] will be lower, but so will the rest of the yield curve,\" said Arvind Narayanan, senior portfolio manager and co-head of investment grade credit at Vanguard. \"You get paid to go a little further [out] on the curve.\" For long-term investors, the appropriate move ahead of a further decline in rates has largely been to add exposure to bonds with a duration of five to seven years. Those who want to squeeze a little more interest income out of cash they'll need in the next 12 to 18 months, however, will need to assess their options. Lock in with ladders Three key considerations for investors holding cash would be liquidity, yield and risk. Financial advisors are still loving high-yield certificate of deposits, even as banks are starting to pull back some of their offerings. \"If there are more cuts [from the Fed], things will shift, and they already have for money market funds,\" said Anna Sergunina, certified financial planner and CEO at Main Street Financial Planning in Los Gatos, Calif. She prefers building a ladder of CDs  for instance, using a lump sum to buy 9-, 12- and 18-month instruments in one shot  to help clients take advantage of today's relatively higher rates. Splitting the money this way also gives investors flexibility and can help deter them from having to \"break,\" or redeem, a CD ahead of maturity in the event money is needed sooner, Sergunina said. Investors can also buy a few short-term Treasury bills with staggered maturities in one go. There are two added benefits for T-bill ladders. First, the money is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. That protection goes beyond the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's protection of up to $250,000 per depositor and per insured bank. Second, interest from Treasury bills is subject to federal income taxes, but it's exempt from state and local levies. CD interest is taxed as ordinary income at state and federal levels. For clients who want ready access to their cash, a high-yield savings account could be a solid bet, Sergunina said. Consider that LendingClub offers 5.3% APY on savings , provided clients can deposit $250 a month. The catch with savings accounts is that banks can always adjust their yields, while CDs lock in rates for the duration of the instrument. \"You can still get some really good interest, but it requires more monitoring,\" said Sergunina. \"The next time the Fed cuts rates, you'll have to keep it in mind.\" A little more interest in exchange for some risk For investors willing to take a bit of risk with their cash in order to generate some more yield, ultrashort bond funds could be worth considering. These funds generally have very limited duration exposure  they tend to have less price sensitivity to fluctuations in rates  and they hold floating rate securities, along with other short-dated instruments. \"You're getting more yield because you're buying credit securities with some spread,\" Narayanan said. Ultrashort bond funds do bring some element of risk: A few of them took their lumps in 2008 during the financial crisis, as they held risky nonagency mortgage bonds and investors cashed out, Amy Arnott, portfolio strategist at Morningstar, wrote in 2023. Investors in ultrashort bond funds will want to keep an eye on credit quality and ensure the fund manager isn't reaching too far for yield. Fees also matter, as expense ratios that are too high erode returns. \"Investors will take [net asset value] risk relative to money market funds, but we think this is the right time in the cycle to do that,\" Narayanan said. \"Duration and rates should act as a tailwind.\" Offerings in the space include Vanguard's Ultra-Short Bond ETF (VUSB) , which has a 30-day SEC yield of 3.9% and an expense ratio of 0.1%, and the Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF (MINT) , which has a 30-day SEC yield of 5% and an expense ratio of 0.35%."

        "content": "Recent hiccups for Nvidia could be the start of broader weakness for the artificial intelligence boom, and investors should consider dialing back their exposure to the stock, according to one small equity research shop. Elazar Advisors downgraded the chipmaker to neutral from buy. Analyst Chaim Siegel said in a note to clients that, while he still believes in the AI story long-term, there are some signs of weakness in the data center business that give reason to be cautious. \"Now we've seen four quarters of decel in the sequential datacenter growth. Off of huge numbers that's fine. But last quarter sequential growth slowed again and now I'm concerned that it can continue to slow in Q3 and Q4. As customers wait for Blackwell, and Blackwell may not be in full-quarter ramp until Q1, there may be continued slowdown for the overall datacenter business,\" the note said. Nvidia's emergence as one of the world's most important companies has been tied to the excitement around AI, with the idea being that Nvidia's advanced semiconductors are needed for the massive computing power required by the recent technological breakthroughs. Elazar is not completely alone in being skeptical of Nvidia, but it's definitely a contrarian stance. Of the 64 analysts tracked by LSEG, 58 have buy or strong buy ratings on Nvidia, with the remaining six having hold ratings. Nvidia's stock is up 700% since the start of 2023, so being bullish has been the right call for Wall Street analysts. However, the stock has slipped 4.6% over the past three months.

        "content": "A major stimulus deal coming out of China could offer a windfall for some U.S. stocks with significant ties to the world's second-largest economy, according to Barclays. \"While not Barclays' base case, a China bazooka stimulus would have far-reaching effects on global assets; luckily, the recent rally has so far been fairly limited to Chinese equities and its proxies, thus leaving room for further upside opportunities, including oil, Industrials, & select U.S.-China-sensitive stocks,\" wrote equities derivatives strategist Stefano Pascale. The picks from Barclays come on the heels of a big stimulus announcement out of China. Last week, the central bank announced a slew of measures to revamp growth and boost the struggling real estate market. However, Pascale warned that despite the strong upward move in Chinese equities on the news, the majority of the near-term gains are likely capped. Against this backdrop, the firm screened for companies with high sales exposure to China and low volatility. Here are some of the potential winners: Barclays named casino and resort operator Wynn Resorts among the beneficiaries of a China stimulus deal, with 48% sales exposure to China. Shares have risen nearly 8% in 2024.The consensus rating on the stock is a buy, according to LSEG data. Qualcomm is another winner, with 62% sales exposure to China and the second-highest among the stocks that made the cut. Shares of the chip stock have popped about 15% this year, benefitting from broader technology tailwinds. Some underperforming stocks could also benefit from China's stimulus plan, including Albemarle . Shares of lithium provider  with 29% exposure to China  have shed more than a third of their value in 2024 due in part to slowing demand for electric vehicles and lower pricing due to oversupply. Merck and Western Digital also made the cut."

        "header": "Evercore ISI gives Harris/Walz and Trump/Vance stock picks to trade election",
        "content": "Though the S & P 500 is up more than 20% in 2024, Evercore ISI sees a patch of volatility ahead as the November presidential election approaches  and the firm has stocks to play either outcome. Ahead of the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday evening, Evercore ISI released a list of stocks that would outperform based on whether Democratic nominee Kamala Harris or Republican nominee Donald Trump becomes president. Evercore senior managing director Julian Emanuel thinks that a divided government  that is, when the presidency and both houses of Congress are controlled by different parties  could actually boost stocks in 2025, contrary to popular belief. \"Despite the potential for Divided Government to further exacerbate divisions in 2025, for investors, 'It Is Different This Time,'\" he wrote. \"While a century of returns shows that United government handily outperforms Divided, the sharp partisan divides in the Country make 2025 a year where stocks are more likely to outperform in the event that government is Divided, as is currently the case.\" Broadly, Emanuel thinks that renewable and electric vehicle stocks would outperform if Harris wins, since those names would benefit from clean energy policies. Health insurers that are leveraged to the Affordable Care Act could also rally on the back of a push to boost enrollment. But financial stocks, utilities with exposure to gas and coal, prescription drug companies and Medicare Advantage-leveraged insurance names could decline due to tougher regulation. Evercore ISI thinks that automotive components manufacturer Aptiv could rise in the event of a Harris/Walz win. The company's stock has plunged nearly 20% this year. But like Evercore ISI, about 73% of analysts covering the name have rated Aptiv as a buy or strong buy, and the average price target suggests upside of roughly 27%, per LSEG. Wells Fargo recently upgraded the company to an overweight rating from equal weight, citing a \"much improved valuation.\" \"After slowing growth & SVA [Smart Vehicle Architecture] concerns, APTV lost most of its growth premium to peers. However, we still see well-above-average growth despite recent moderation,\" wrote analyst Colin Langan. Regional bank PNC Financial Services could also benefit from a Democratic president. Evercore ISI called the bank \"a flight to quality name,\" saying it was in a competitive position despite an uncertain backdrop. Shares of PNC are up 19% in 2024. The average price target implies nearly 2% upside, per LSEG, 15 out of 24 analysts cover the stock are still bullish on the name. In a September report, UBS analyst Brian Meredith pinpointed PNC as one of his top picks in North American financials. \"PNC is well positioned to deliver outsized NII [net interest income] growth in 2025 driven by hedging activity, repricing of fixed rate assets, and a recent securities repositioning,\" he wrote. On the other hand, the sectors that would outperform in the case of a Trump win include those that would benefit most from deregulation, such as financials and energy, alongside defense stocks. Emanuel added that the losing stocks could include auto and agriculture names, which would be most exposed to intensified trade wars. If Trump wins, Charter Communications is one stock that could benefit from a \"potentially benign tax environment\" and a pickup in M & A activity, Evercore ISI said. The telecommunications stock is currently down roughly 17% on the year. Nearly 60% of the analysts covering Charter have a hold rating on the name, but see a potential upside of nearly 13% on average, according to LSEG. In September, Citi upgraded Charter to a neutral rating from sell. \"Charter is targeting significant improvement in EBITDA during 2H24 with its previously announced efforts to reduce expenses that can also support flattish EBITDA for 2025,\" wrote analyst Michael Rollins. Supermarket operator Kroger could also outperform due to its ability to pass through higher prices to consumers, according to Evercore ISI. Shares of Kroger have already rallied 25% this year. Twelve out of 22 analysts covering the name rate it buy or strong buy, according to LSEG. Consensus price targets imply nearly 3% upside from current levels. CFRA upgraded Kroger to a buy rating from hold in September. \"Our upgrade reflects improving sales momentum, margin expansion opportunities, and a relatively underwhelming valuation compared to retail peers,\" wrote analyst Arun Sundaram."

Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Savita Subramanian upgraded the materials group to overweight from market weight, saying in a note to clients that this sector has the highest correlation to Chinese equities and stands to benefit most from a wave of economic stimulus measures in China. That theory played out during last week's rally for Chinese stocks. The Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB) rose 3% last week, though it was down a bit on Monday and Tuesday. The fund's top holdings include Linde , Sherwin-Williams and Freeport-McMoRan . XLB 1M mountain This materials fund is up since the Chinese stock rally began. The group  consisting of everything from miners to chemical and cardboard makers  could also benefit from the Federal Reserve's easier monetary policy in the form of lower interest rates, according to Bank of America. \"Materials saw the biggest earnings swoon of all sectors since hiking began, suggesting the biggest potential upside in earnings on an accelerating profits cycle amid Fed cuts,\" Subramanian said. Bank of America isn't the only Wall Street shop that's bullish on materials given the change in China. Roth MKM's JC O'Hara also highlighted the group earlier in the week."

        "header": "What a resurgence in Wall Street dealmaking means for Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo",
        "content": "Great news for Club stocks Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley : The rebound in investment banking isn't over yet. The catalyst? Dealmaking is expected to continue to rise as the Federal Reserve delivers more interest rate cuts. This should, in turn, boost revenues for a key business within both Wall Street firms. We'll find out to what extent when Wells Fargo reports earnings on Oct. 11 and Morgan Stanley delivers quarterly results on Oct. 16. Lower borrowing costs tend to spur mergers and acquisitions (M & A) and initial public offerings (IPO), which means more business for the banks. Recent numbers from consulting firm KPMG and financial data provider S & P Global Market Intelligence indicate a solid pickup in activity for M & A and IPOs already. So far in 2024, mergers and acquisitions transaction values and money raised from initial public offerings are largely outperforming all of last year's lackluster activity. U.S. mergers and acquisitions rose 37% to $1.3 trillion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, according to KPMG, citing data through Sept. 15. Global M & A transaction values so far this year of roughly $2 trillion have already beat 2023's total of $1.6 trillion, according to S & P Global data captured on Oct. 1. The IPO market has improved, too. According to KPMG, public offerings listed in the U.S. raised $28.3 billion during the first nine months of 2024. That's up 50% year over year. All of this bodes well for the kind of advisory and underwriting fees that investment banks can charge to facilitate these deals. To be sure, M & A and IPO values are still down significantly from their Covid peaks in 2021 after the Fed delivered two emergency rate cuts in March 2020 that took the cost of borrowing to near zero. Rates remained that way until March 2022 when central bankers started their tightening cycle to fight inflation. The Fed hiked rates 11 times over 18 months before cutting rates by 50 basis points last month. Speaking at a National Association for Business Economics event in Nashville, Tennessee, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that he expects an additional 50 basis points worth of rate cuts this year  25 in November and 25 in December. The market is not quite ready to take Powell at his word. As of Tuesday, the CME FedWatch tool was putting roughly 66% odds on a 50 basis point cut in December. Rebecca Brokmeier, group head of KPMG's investment banking platform, sees \"an increase in new deals in the market in the fourth calendar quarter and expects this trend to continue as we move into 2025\" while the Fed continues to lower rates. Brokmeier told CNBC Tuesday that a lot of this activity is expected to be driven by private equity, which is \"more reliant on low interest rates for transactions than corporations and have record levels of dry powder to deploy as well as long-held assets that must be exited in order to return cash to their investors.\" MS YTD mountain Morgan Stanley (MS) year-to-date performance For Morgan Stanley, a resurgence in its investment banking division is crucial to our investment thesis and why we stuck with it. Following nearly two downbeat years, we saw reason to be optimistic about Morgan Stanley's IB business last quarter, which was out in July. IB segment revenue jumped 51%. Breaking IB down further, advisory and equity underwriting fees both surged 30% and 56%, respectively, from the prior year. Last month, however, Jim Cramer criticized the stock's underperformance , adding that he was considering exiting Morgan Stanley and swapping in investment banking rival Goldman Sachs , where he used to work during his days on Wall Street. Part of that underperformance came after co-president Dan Simkowitz said that M & A and IPOs will remain below trend for the rest of 2024 at an industry conference. To be sure, he also predicted that this activity would accelerate in 2025 as the Fed lowers rates. \"Morgan Stanley is in no man's land, too low to sell and too high to buy. That means wait, which is exactly what we are doing,\" Jim said during the Club's Monthly Meeting on Sept. 12, two days after Simkowitz's comments. \"It might be time to say goodbye and pick up some of the much better run Goldman Sachs.\" A week later, Morgan Stanley stock rose on the Fed rate cut, and the Club settled for trimming the position . Morgan Stanley has diversified its portfolio and moved more heavily into wealth management in recent years to reduce its exposure to the volatility of the IB business. So, it remains to be seen how investment banking performance fits into the whole profit picture. WFC YTD mountain Wells Fargo (WFC) year-to-date Morgan Stanley's IB business is much larger than Wells Fargo's. However, Wells Fargo, known for its roots as a traditional money center bank, has been working diligently to build out its dealmaking side of the shop. It's kind of the opposite of Morgan Stanley. Wells Fargo, which has a strong wealth management franchise, is branching out to take a slice of the IB pie. Wells has made a series of senior-level hires in recent years to expand its corporate and investment banking (CIB) division. This helps the bank rely less on interest-based incomes from its consumer lending business, which have been long at the mercy of the Fed's monetary policy decisions.We've seen positive signs already, as CIB revenue jumped 38% year over year in the July quarter. \"We continued to see growth in our fee-based revenue offsetting an expected decline in net interest income,\" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said during the July 12 earnings call. \"The investments we have been making allowed us to take advantage of the market activity in the quarter with strong performance in investment advisory, trading and investment banking fees.\" In another positive development in Scharf's bid to clean up the bank's past missteps and get regulatory permission to expand, Bloomberg News reported last week that Wells Fargo submitted a third-party review of its risk and control overhauls to the Fed in an effort to get the central bank-mandated $1.95 trillion asset cap removed. The restriction was put in place by the Fed in 2018 after a series of scandals under previous leadership. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long WFC, MS. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Friday's key moments. 1. Wall Street was mixed Friday but still heading for solid weekly gains. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped, but the S & P 500 was little changed after the August reading of the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge came in tame. Headline and core PCE were getting closer to the Fed's 2% inflation target. Next Friday, investors get the September jobs report, the latest look at the health of the second part of the central bank's dual mandate: the labor market. The economic data between now and the Fed's meeting on Nov. 6-7 will be key to how much further interest rates will be cut. 2. Shares of Best Buy rose more than 2% on Friday after JPMorgan added the stock to its analyst focus list. The analysts have had a buy-equivalent rating on the stock since February, which is around when we started buying. Looking back, that was a good call with shares up 30% year to date. JPMorgan sees value because investors are underappreciating the AI-powered personal computer cycle and the potential for TVs and appliances to inflect as housing improves. Other housing plays in our portfolio include Stanley Black & Decker and Home Depot . 3. Wells Fargo shares were slightly lower Friday, one day after popping 5% on an encouraging Bloomberg News report about the Fed-mandated asset cap, which was put in place at the bank in 2018. Bloomberg reported that Wells Fargo submitted a third-party review of its risk and control overhauls to the Fed for sign-off to remove the cap. Despite Thursday's gains, Wells Fargo shares are having a tough month. The bank delivers quarterly earnings on Oct. 11. Our other financial name, Morgan Stanley , reports Oct. 16.

        "header": "Commerzbank and UniCredit hold talks as takeover prospect looms",
        "content": "Commerzbank  and  UniCredit  began initial talks Friday, with the German bank on the defensive over a potential takeover after its Italian counterpart unexpectedly increased its stake earlier this month. The discussions, which included incoming Commerzbank Chief Executive Bettina Orlopp, were held over Zoom and ended early afternoon local time on Friday, Reuters reported, though no outcome was immediately apparent. Orlopp on Thursday said the two banks would \"exchange views\" Friday, Reuters reported. Speaking at a financial conference, Orlopp said the German bank was open minded, but that the speed of synergies and risks needed to be considered. UniCredit earlier this month took a  9% stake  in Commerzbank, before looking to  boost it to 21%  earlier this week and putting in a request to hold as much as a 29.9% stake in the German bank, hinting at a potential takeover bid. The action took the German government, which also owns a stake in the bank, and the management of Commerzbank by surprise. Orlopp said Thursday she would not get involved with \"crazy\" sell-downs or \"stupid things,\" according to Reuters. A 10-year veteran of Commerzbank, Orlopp was announced Tuesday as the  incoming CEO , replacing Manfred Knof who is set to  leave the bank  at the end of this month. Her comments on Thursday came as the bank's board of managing directors and supervisory board unanimously said they supported Commerzbank's current strategy at an annual meeting. Germany's second-largest lender said in a Thursday  statement  that the implementation of its strategy plans until 2027 was \"progressing rapidly.\" \"Commerzbank is continuously expanding its independent position as a strong pillar in the German banking market and a reliable partner to the domestic economy,\" Jens Weidmann, chairman of the supervisory board, commented. The statement also noted that the board of managing directors was now expecting the bank's return on tangible equity and payouts to shareholders to be bigger than so far anticipated. The potential for a takeover or merger has been met with opposition from  Germany's government  and several senior figures at Commerzbank. Supervisory board member Stefan Wittmann this week  told CNBC  he hoped a hostile takeover could be avoided, and said major job losses could occur if it became a reality. Some investors however have in recent days suggested they would be open to talks about a potential merger. Orlopp herself  earlier this month told journalists that the process had taken Commerzbank by surprise, but urged a calm approach."

        "content": "European banking's latest takeover battle is widely regarded as a potential turning point forthe region  particularly the bloc'sincomplete banking union. Italy's  UniCredit has  ratcheted up the pressure  on Frankfurt-based  Commerzbank  in recent weeks as it seeks to become the biggest investor in Germany's second-largest lender with a  21% stake . The Milan-based bank, which took a  9% stake in Commerzbank earlier this month, appears to have caught German authorities off guard with the potential multibillion-euro merger. \"The long-discussed move by UniCredit, Italy's number one bank, to seek control of Germany's Commerzbank is a watershed for Germany and Europe,\" David Marsh, chairman of London-based OMFIF, an organization that tracks central banking and economic policy,  said  Tuesday in a written commentary. Whatever the outcome of UniCredit's swoop on Commerzbank, Marsh said the episode marks \"another huge test\" for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The embattled German leader is firmly opposed to the apparent takeover attempt and has reportedly described UniCredit's move as an \"unfriendly\" and \"hostile\" attack. \"The dispute between Germany and Italy over UniCredit's takeover manoeuvres  branded by Scholz an unfriendly act  threatens to inflame relations between two of the Big Three member states of the European Union,\" Marsh said. \"A compromise could still be found,\" he continued. \"But the hostility developing in Italy and Germany could scupper any meaningful steps towards completing banking union and capital markets integration, which all sides say is necessary to drag Europe out of its malaise.\" Designed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, the European Union's executive arm in 2012 announced plans to create a banking union to make sure that lenders across the region were stronger and better supervised. The project, which became a reality in 2014 when the European Central Bank assumed its role as a banking supervisor, is widely considered to be incomplete. For instance, the lack of a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) is one of a number of factors that has been  cited  as a barrier to progress. European leaders, including Germany's Scholz, have  repeatedly called  for greater integration in Europe's banking sector. OMFIF's Marsh said Germany's opposition to UniCredit's move on Commerzbank means Berlin \"now stands accused of favouring European banking integration only on its own terms.\" A spokesperson for Germany's government did not immediately respond when contacted by CNBC for comment. Hostile takeover bids are not common in the European banking sector, although Spanish bank BBVA   shocked markets  in May when it launched an all-share takeover offer for domestic rival  Banco Sabadell . The head of Banco Sabadell said earlier this month that it is highly unlikely BBVA will succeed with its multi-billion-euro hostile bid,  Reuters reported . And yet, BBVA CEO Onur Gen told CNBC on Wednesday that the takeover was \"moving according to plan.\" Spanish authorities, which have the power to block any merger or acquisition of a bank, have  voiced their opposition  to BBVA's hostile takeover bid, citing potentially harmful effects on the county's financial system. Mario Centeno, a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" on Tuesday that European policymakers have been working for more than a decade to establish a \"true banking union\"  and continue to do so. The unfinished project means that the intervention framework for banking crises continues to be \"an awkward mix\" of national and EU authorities and instruments, according to Brussels-based think tank  Bruegel . Asked whether comments opposing banking consolidation from leading politicians in both Germany and Spain were a source of frustration, the ECB's Centeno replied, \"We have been working very hard in Europe to bring [the] banking union to completion. There are still some issues on the table, that we all know.\" Thomas Schweppe, founder of Frankfurt-based advisory firm 7Square and a former Goldman mergers and acquisitions banker, said Germany's decision  intentional or otherwise  to sell a small 4.5% stake to UniCredit earlier this month meant the bank was now \"in play\" for a potential takeover. \"I think we are, you know, proposing a European banking landscape and also in Germany, they are a proponent of strong European banks that have a good capital base and are managed well,\" Schweppe told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday. \"If we mean this seriously, I think we need to accept that European consolidation also means that a German bank becomes the acquired party,\" he added. Asked for a timeline on how long the UniCredit-Commerzbank saga was likely to drag on, Schweppe said it could run for months, \"if not a year or more.\" He cited a lengthy regulatory process and the need for talks between all stakeholders to find a \"palatable\" solution."

Speaking to CNBC's Charlotte Reed at the Bank of America Financials CEO Conference, BNP Paribas Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil voiced his support for greater integration in Europe's banking sector. His comments come as Italy's  UniCredit  ups the ante on its apparent takeover attempt of Germany's  Commerzbank , while Spain's  BBVA continues to actively pursue its domestic rival, Banco Sabadell . \"If I would ask you, how many banks are there in Europe, your right answer would be too many,\" Machenil said. \"If we are very fragmented in activity, therefore the competition is not the same thing as what you might see in other regions. So ... you basically should get that consolidation and get that going,\" he added.

BNP Paribas's Machenil said that while domestic consolidation would help to stabilize uncertainty in Europe's banking environment, cross-border integration was \"still a bit further away,\" citing differing systems and products. Asked whether this meant he believed cross-border banking mergers in Europe appeared to something of a farfetched reality, Machenil replied: \"It's two different things.\" \"I think the ones which are in a nation, economically, they make sense, and they should, economically, happen,\" he continued. \"When you look at really cross border. So, a bank that is based in one country only and based in another country only, that economically doesn't make sense because there are no synergies.\" Earlier in the year, Spanish bank BBVA  shocked markets when it launched an all-share takeover offer for domestic rival Banco Sabadell.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Harvest Volatility Management and Merrill Lynch on Wednesday for exceeding clients' predesignated investment limits over a two-year period. Merrill, owned by  Bank of America , and Harvest have agreed in separate settlements to pay a combined $9.3 million in penalties to resolve the claims. Harvest was the primary investment advisor and portfolio manager for the Collateral Yield Enhancement Strategy, which traded options in a volatility index aimed at incremental returns. Beginning in 2016, Harvest allowed a plethora of accounts to exceed the exposure levels that investors had already designated when they signed up for the enhancement strategy, with dozens passing the limit by 50% or more, according to the SEC's orders. The SEC said Merrill connected its clients to Harvest while it knew that investors' accounts were exceeding the set exposure levels under Harvest's management. Merrill also received a cut of Harvest's trading commissions and management and incentive fees, according to the agency. Both Merrill and Harvest received larger management fees while investors were exposed to greater financial risks, the SEC said. Both companies were found to neglect policies and procedures that could have been adopted to alert investors of exposure exceeding the designated limits. \"In this case, two investment advisers allegedly sold a complex options trading strategy to their clients, but failed to abide by basic client instructions or implement and adhere to appropriate policies and procedures,\" said Mark Cave, associate director of the SEC's enforcement division. \"Today's action holds Merrill and Harvest accountable for dropping the ball in executing these basic duties to their clients, even as their clients' financial exposure grew well beyond predetermined limits.\" A representative from Bank of America said the company \"ended all new enrollments with Harvest in 2019 and recommended that existing clients unwind their positions.\""

        "header": "Bettina Orlopp: The woman tasked with leading Commerzbank amid UniCredit takeover battle",
        "content": "Commerzbank  announced Tuesday it has picked 10-year veteran, and current Chief Financial Officer Bettina Orlopp to helm the bank as chief executive as it seeks to fend off a potential hostile takeover from Italian bank UniCredit. The bank has been on the defensive as  UniCredit  looks to become its largest shareholder, signaling the potential for a full takeover. Earlier this month, the Milan-based bank started building its shareholding with a 9% stake in Commerzbank.  UniCredit  then announced this week it had acquired additional Commerzbank shares, taking its stake in the German lender to around 21%, and submitted a request to increase its holdings to 29.9%. Senior officials at Commerzbank and the German government, which was the companys largest shareholder until UniCredit stepped in, have both said they oppose a hostile takeover. Orlopp will now be put in charge of leading the fight. Commerzbank  said  in a late Tuesday statement that its supervisory board is aiming for current Chief Executive Manfred Knof to hand over his duties to Orlopp, in the near future. The firm added that the board had agreed unanimously on Orlopp succeeding Knof after an internal and external search for candidates. Later on Wednesday the bank announced Knof will leave the company at the end of the month on September 30. Orlopps contract is set out for five years, Commerzbank said, noting that the search for her replacement as CFO is still underway. The CFO said she was looking forward to this new challenge,while also noting thatsignificant tasks lie ahead. Together with all our key partners, we will navigate through the challenges ahead of us successfully, she said. Since March 2020 , Orlopp has been Commerzbanks CFO, covering finance, investor relations, tax and treasury departments, according to her  bio on the banks website . Most recently she was also the deputy chairwoman of the board of directors at the German bank, a position she has held  since 2021 . The 54-year-old banker initially joined Commerzbank in 2014 as a divisional board member for group development and strategy. Since then, Orlopp has worked as an executive board member and then member of the board of managing directors overseeing areas including compliance, legal and human resources divisions. Prior to her time at Commerzbank, Orlopp worked at McKinsey for 19 years. She holds a business administration diploma from the University of Regensburg, where she also completed a doctorate in finance. Orlopp told journalists last week that current developments with UniCredit were unexpected, but urged calm. We have all been very surprised by the process, she said according to  Reuters . Thats why the most important thing now is simply to sort it out calmly, to think about whats on the table now and how to deal with it, she added. Other officials at Commerzbank have been more direct in sharing their concerns about a tie-up with the Italian bank. Stefan Wittman, supervisory board member at Commerzbank, on Tuesday  told CNBC  we certainly hope we can avoid a hostile takeover and warned that major job losses could occur if UniCredit took over. This is not Orlopps first tumultuous time at Commerzbank. She was at the bank when it began the process of restructuring in 2016 and throughout periods of merger considerations,  including interest from Deutsche Bank  in 2018 and 2019. When Orlopp became CFO in 2020, the bank was facing pressure from U.S. private equity group Cerberus, which at the time held an around 5% stake in Commerzbank, according to Reuters. The activist investor demanded personnel and strategy  including cost cutting  changes at the German lender. The  pressure from shareholders to reduce costs  saw both the CEO and chairman of the supervisory board at the time, resign from their positions. Knof was then  named CEO  in 2020 and officially took on the role in 2021. Thomas Schweppe, founder of 7Square, on Wednesday told CNBC that he believed it was important that the decision to make Orlopp CEO was taken quickly. The situation is untenable. You cannot defend a company without a credible CEO, he said. Orlopps extensive experience at Commerzbank will allow her to hit the ground running, which is very very important, Schweppe said. At the same time obviously she has been part of some decisions that potentially led to the, you know, difficult situation Commerzbank finds itself now in, he added. "

        "header": "Caught cold by UniCredit\u2019s swoop on Commerzbank, Germany will want to avoid a national embarrassment",
        "content": "Italy's  UniCredit  appears to have caught German authorities off guard with a potential multibillion-euro merger of Frankfurt-based  Commerzbank , a move that has triggered a fiery response from Berlin. Market observers told CNBC that the swoop may have provoked a sense of national embarrassment among Germany's government, which firmly opposes the move, while it's been argued that the outcome of the takeover attempt could even put the meaning of the European project at stake. Milan-based UniCredit announced on Monday that it had  increased its stake  in Commerzbank to around 21% and submitted a request to boost that holding to up to 29.9%. It follows UniCredit's move to take a  9% stake  in Commerzbank earlier this month. \"If UniCredit can take Commerzbank and take it to their level of efficiency, there's a tremendous upside in terms of increased profitability,\" Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday. \"But [German Chancellor] Olaf Scholz is not an investor. He's a politician and he's very concerned about the jobs side of things. And if you look at what UniCredit has done in terms of slimming down things in its Italian operations or particularly in its German operations, it's been quite impressive,\" Marenzi said. Scholz on Monday criticized UniCredit's decision to up the ante on Commerzbank, describing the move as an \"unfriendly\" and \"hostile\" attack, Reuters reported. Commerzbank's Deputy Chair Uwe Tschaege, meanwhile, reportedly voiced opposition to a potential takeover by UniCredit on Tuesday. Speaking outside of the lender's headquarters in central Frankfurt, Tschaege said the message was simple and clear: \"We don't want this.\" \"I feel like vomiting when I hear his promises of cost savings,\" Tschaege reportedly added, referring to UniCredit 's CEO Andrea Orcel. Separately, Stefan Wittman, a Commerzbank supervisory board member,  told CNBC on Tuesday  that as many as two-thirds of the jobs at the bank could disappear if UniCredit successfully carries out a hostile takeover. The bank has yet to respond to a request for comment on Wittmann's statement. Hostile takeover bids are not common in the European banking sector, although Spanish bank  BBVA   shocked markets  in May when it launched an all-share takeover offer for domestic rival  Banco Sabadell . The latter Spanish lender rejected the bid. Opimas' Marenzi said the German government and trade unions \"are basically looking at this and saying this means we could lose a bunch of jobs in the process  and it could be quite substantial job losses.\" \"The other thing is there might be a bit of a national embarrassment that the Italians are coming in and showing them how to run their banks,\" he added. A spokesperson for Germany's government was not immediately available when contacted by CNBC on Tuesday. Germany's Scholz has  previously  pushed for the completion of a European banking union. Designed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, the European Union's executive arm announced plans to create a banking union to improve the regulation and supervision of lenders across the region. Craig Coben, former global head of equity capital markets at Bank of America, said the German government would need to find \"very good\" reasons to block UniCredit's move on Commerzbank, warning that it would also have to be consistent with the principles around European integration. \"I think it is very difficult for UniCredit to take over or to reach an agreement on Commerzbank without the approval of the German government, just as a practical matter  but I think Germany needs to find a legitimate excuse if it wants to intervene [or] if it wants to block the approach from UniCredit,\" Coben told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday. \"Germany has signed up to the [EU's] single market, it has signed up to the single currency, it has signed up to [the] banking union and so it would be inconsistent with those principles to block the merger on the grounds of national interest,\" he continued. \"And I think that's really what's at stake here: what is the meaning of [the] banking union? And what is the meaning of the European project?\" Former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi  said  in a report published earlier this month that the European Union needs hundreds of billions of euros in additional investment to meet its key competitiveness targets. Draghi, who has previously served as Italian prime minister, also cited the \"incomplete\" banking union in the report as one factor that continues to hinder competitiveness for the region's banks.  CNBC's April Roach contributed to this report."

        "header": "Justice Department accuses Visa of debit network monopoly that affects price of \u2018nearly everything\u2019",
        "content": "The U.S.  Justice Department  on Tuesday sued  Visa , the worlds biggest payments network, saying it propped up an illegal monopoly over debit payments by imposing exclusionary agreements on partners and smothering upstart firms. Visas moves over the years have resulted in American consumers and merchants paying billions of dollars in additional fees, according to the DOJ, which filed a civil antitrust suit in New York for monopolization and other unlawful conduct. We allege that Visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market, Attorney General  Merrick Garland  said in a DOJ release. Merchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, either by raising prices or reducing quality or service, Garland said. As a result, Visas unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing  but the price of nearly everything. Visa and its smaller rival  Mastercard  have surged over the past two decades, reaching a combined market cap of roughly $1 trillion, as consumers tapped credit and debit cards for store purchases and e-commerce instead of paper money. They are essentially toll collectors, shuffling payments between banks operating for the merchants and for cardholders. Visa called the DOJ suit meritless. Anyone who has bought something online, or checked out at a store, knows there is an ever-expanding universe of companies offering new ways to pay for goods and services, said Visa general counsel Julie Rottenberg. Todays lawsuit ignores the reality that Visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing, with entrants who are thriving, Rottenberg said. We are proud of the payments network we have built, the innovation we advance, and the economic opportunity we enable. More than 60% of debit transactions in the U.S. run over Visa rails, helping it charge more than $7 billion annually in processing fees, according to the DOJ complaint. The payment networks decades-old dominance has increasingly attracted attention from regulators and retailers. In 2020, the DOJ filed an  antitrust suit  to block Visa from acquiring fintech company Plaid. The companies initially said they would fight the action, but soon abandoned the $5.3 billion takeover. In March, Visa and Mastercard agreed to  limit their fees  and let merchants charge customers for using credit cards, a deal retailers said was worth $30 billion in savings over a half decade. A federal judge later  rejected  the settlement, saying the networks could afford to pay for a substantially greater deal. In its complaint, the DOJ said Visa threatens merchants and their banks with punitive rates if they route a meaningful share of debit transactions to competitors, helping maintain Visas network moat. The contracts help insulate three-quarters of Visas debit volume from fair competition, the DOJ said.  Visa wields its dominance, enormous scale, and centrality to the debit ecosystem to impose a web of exclusionary agreements on merchants and banks, the DOJ said in its release. These agreements penalize Visas customers who route transactions to a different debit network or alternative payment system. Furthermore, when faced with threats, Visa engaged in a deliberate and reinforcing course of conduct to cut off competition and prevent rivals from gaining the scale, share, and data necessary to compete, the DOJ said. The moves also tamped down innovation, according to the DOJ. Visa pays competitors hundreds of millions of dollars annually to blunt the risk they develop innovative new technologies that could advance the industry but would otherwise threaten Visas monopoly profits, according to the complaint. Visa has agreements with tech players including  Apple ,  PayPal  and  Square , turning them from potential rivals to partners in a way that hurts the public, the DOJ said. For instance, Visa chose to sign an agreement with a predecessor to the Cash App product to ensure that the company, later rebranded Block, did not create a bigger threat to Visas debit rails. A Visa manager was quoted as saying weve got Square on a short leash and our deal structure was meant to protect against disintermediation, according to the complaint. Visa has an agreement with Apple in which the tech giant says it will not directly compete with the payment network such ascreating payment functionality that relies primarily on non-Visa payment processes, the complaint alleged. The DOJ asked for the courts to prevent Visa from a range of anticompetitive practices, including fee structures or service bundles that discourage new entrants. The move comes in the waning months of President  Joe Biden s administration, in which regulators including theFederal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have sued middlemen for  drug prices  and pushed back against so-called  junk fees . In February, credit card lender Capital One  announced  its acquisition of  Discover Financial , a $35.3 billion deal predicated in part on Capital Ones ability to bolster Discovers also-ran payments network, a distant No. 4 behind Visa, Mastercard and  American Express . Capital One said once the deal is closed, it will switch all its debit card volume and a growing share of credit card volume to Discover over time, making it a more viable competitor to Visa and Mastercard."

        "header": "Commerzbank board member warns of significant job losses with a hostile UniCredit takeover ",
        "content": "Two-thirds of the jobs at  Commerzbank  could disappear if  UniCredit  successfully carries out a hostile takeover of the German lender, a Commerzbank supervisory board member warned on Tuesday. Stefan Wittmann, who is also a senior official at German trade union Verdi, told CNBC's Annette Weisbach that \"we certainly hope we can avoid\" a hostile takeover by the Italian bank. Witmann said Commerzbank's board had called on the German government to carry out an internal review of the possible takeover, which he hopes will give the bank a six-month period to take stock of the situation. \"But if it [a hostile takeover] is unavoidable, we think that two-thirds of jobs will disappear, that there will be another significant cut in the branches,\" he said, according to a translation. \"We will see in particular that UniCredit does not want all Commerzbank customers at all, but that it focuses on the supposedly best customers, namely the wealthy customers,\" he added. Berlin, which was the largest shareholder of Commerzbank after it injected 18.2 billion euros ($20.2 billion) to rescue the lender during the 2008 financial crisis, is likely to play a key role in any potential merger between the banks. \"We are actually concerned with our economic and industrial responsibility. As far as the workforce is concerned, which trade unions are of course particularly focused on, they would always lose out in the merger, regardless of the point in time,\" Wittmann said. The bank has yet to respond to a request for comment on Wittmann's statements. UniCredit announced Monday it had increased its stake in the German lender to around 21% and submitted a request to boost that holding to up to 29.9%, signaling a takeover bid might be in the cards. Earlier this month, the Italian bank took a 9% stake in Commerzbank, confirming that half of this shareholding was acquired from the German government. UniCredit believes substantial value can be unlocked within Commerzbank, Germany's second-largest lender, but it said that further action is required for that value to be \"crystalized.\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz criticized UniCredit's move on Monday, saying, \"unfriendly attacks, hostile takeovers are not a good thing for banks and that is why the German government has clearly positioned itself in this direction,\" Reuters reported. Commerzbank's supervisory board is due to meet this week to discuss UniCredit's stake, people familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous  previously told CNBC . Wittmann said the mood is currently \"very tense\" within the company, adding that the bank was surprised by UniCredit's announcement on Monday, which he described as a \"180 degree-turn within 48 hours.\" \"[UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel] last spoke on Friday that he wanted a friendly takeover in agreement with all stakeholders and politicians. And yesterday we were surprised by his hostile takeover attempt. That doesn't add up,\" Wittmann said. The supervisory board member explained that the two main reasons to regard a potential merger in a critical light are the lack of a banking union in Europe, and the fact that UniCredit has \"absorbed itself with Italian government bonds in recent years.\" He questioned what might happen should geopolitical tensions or \"upheavals\" impact UniCredit's availability of capital to finance Commerzbank's industry. In response to the 2008 financial crisis, the European Commission announced plans to create a banking union to improve the regulation and supervision of banks across the region. Economist and former European Central Bank Governor Mario Draghi flagged in a recent  report  that banks in Europe face regulatory hurdles which \"constrain their capacity to lend,\" also citing the \"incomplete\" banking union as one factor that impacts competitiveness for the region's banks. \"We have always spoken out, including as employee representatives on the Supervisory Board, that there can and should be mergers at [a] European level, but only when the banking union is in place. And that is just our second point of criticism, that we say: create the rules of the game and the guardrails first, and then do it sensibly when it is clear which playing field we are on,\" Wittmann said."

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. Stocks opened higher Monday in a continuation of last week's momentum, which saw all major indexes gain more than 1%. The Dow closed Friday at a record while the S & P 500 did so Thursday . The strength followed the Federal Reserve's half-percentage point interest rate cut Wednesday. Health care, a classic defensive sector, is underperforming Monday as investors grow more confident in the possibility of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, technology  and the semiconductor industry, more specifically  are having a mixed day as Wall Street weighs reports around Intel . In addition to last week's reports that Qualcomm has discussed buying Intel, Bloomberg News said private equity giant Apollo Global Management has approached the struggling chipmaker with an multibillion investment offer. 2. Despite a slight dip in the S & P 500 Friday, the S & P Short Range Oscillator moved further into overbought territory at 7.3%. A session prior, Jim Cramer's trusted momentum indicator was at 6.68%. We want to see some market choppiness to work off the overbought reading  as a reminder, anything above 4% on the Oscillator is considered overbought. In this environment, we prefer to raise cash rather than buying stocks. That helps explain why we trimmed Morgan Stanley last week during the post-Fed rate cut rally. Another reason for offloading some shares is the possibility of switching to a different financial stock such as Goldman Sachs , a move Jim has been considering for some time now. 3. Wall Street's early checks for Apple 's new iPhone 16, which hit stores Friday, remain all over the place. Barclays concluded there's muted demand across both Pro and base models due to shorter lead times compared with last year. Conversely, JPMorgan observed expanding lead times mid-week, suggesting \"healthy demand\" overall, though lead times were a little softer versus last year on higher-end Pro and Pro Max models. Citigroup analysts also reported an increase in delivery times for the base and Pro models. Director of Portfolio Analysis Jeff Marks advised investors to minimize the noise. \"If you're trying to trade it on every headline, you would have missed such a fantastic move,\" Jeff said, alluding to our \"own it, don't trade it\" mantra. Additionally, last week T-Mobile's CEO told Jim in an interview that initial demand for the iPhone 16 looked good relative to the iPhone 15 a year ago.

        "content": "UniCredit  announced on Monday it had increased its stake in German lender  Commerzbank  to around 21% and submitted a request to boost the holding to up to 29.9%. The Italian bank acquired the additional Commerzbank shares through financial instruments, it said in a Monday statement. Earlier this month, UniCredit announced it had taken a 9% stake in Commerzbank, confirming that half of this shareholding was acquired from the German government. \"UniCredit believes that there is substantial value that can be unlocked within Commerzbank, either stand-alone or within UniCredit, for the benefit of Germany and the bank's wider stakeholders. However, as was the case for UniCredit, such potential requires action for it to be crystalized,\" the bank said on Monday. It added that it has hedged the majority of its exposure to Commerzbank in order to provide UniCredit with \"full flexibility and optionality to either retain its shareholding, sell its participation with a floored downside, or increase the stake further.\" Its next move will depend on engagement with Commerzbank's management and supervisory boards as well as its \"wider stakeholders in Germany,\" the bank said. Berlin has been a major shareholder of Commerzbank since it injected 18.2 billion euros ($20.2 billion) to rescue the lender during the 2008 financial crisis. German government officials met last Friday to discuss the state's shareholding in Commerzbank. They concluded that the bank is a \"stable and profitable institute\" and its \"strategy is geared towards independence. The Federal government will accompany this until further notice by maintaining its shareholding,\" the agency said in a Google-translated statement. The German government does not support a takeover of Commerzbank and has communicated this to UniCredit, sources from the finance ministry said Monday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also criticized the move on Monday, saying, \"unfriendly attacks, hostile takeovers are not a good thing for banks and that is why the German government has clearly positioned itself in this direction,\" Reuters reported. Commerzbank declined to comment further on the situation. Shares of  Commerzbank closed around 6% lower Monday, while UniCredit shares slipped 3%. The state is likely to play a key role in any potential takeover of the German bank. Last week, UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel told local media \"it would be an aggressive move\" for his firm to launch an unsolicited tender offer to buy out other investors in Commerzbank, Reuters reported. Orcel also cited the German government's \"trust\" in the Italian bank as the reason why it was able to buy 4.5% of the state's stake in Commerzbank. On Monday UniCredit noted that it has been present in Germany for nearly 20 years and stressed the importance of a \"strong banking union\" in Europe as being key for the bloc's economic success. Analysts are hoping that a move from UniCredit will encourage  more cross-border consolidation  in Europe's banking sector which is often seem as more fragmented in comparison to the U.S."

It then increases annually until it returns to its original level. CrossCountry offers a variety of buydowns, including a 3-2-1 buydown, which drops the rate 3% in the first year, 2% in the second year and 1% in the third year, before returning to the original mortgage rate in the fourth year. Other options include 2-1, 1-1 and 1-0 buydowns. CrossCountry Mortgage offers cash-out and rate-and-term refinancing in all 50 U.S. states and , Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. It also provides HELOCs but does not offer home equity loans. J.D. Power rated  CrossCountry Mortgage  above average in customer satisfaction for  mortgage origination  and  servicing . The lender received an A+ rating from the  Better Business Bureau , which bases ratings on corporate transparency, truthful advertising, response to consumer complaints and other factors. CrossCountry Mortgage does not list sample or customized rates online and lacks an online chat feature, which many competitors have. You can't get preapproved online either, but you can submit a mortgage application through the CrossCountry Mortgage website.  Here's how CrossCountry Mortgage stacks up to two leading mortgage providers. Guild  and  CrossCountry Mortgage both lend in all 50 states and have hundreds of branches nationwide. The two lenders accept alternative credit for some loans and offer government-backed VA, FHA and USDA mortages. However, while both issue HELOCs, only Guild has  home equity loans . It's not clear how they match up on rates, as Guild's are not publicly advertised. It does not typically charge homebuyers an origination fee, though, which can equal between 0.5% and 1% of your total loan amount. CrossCountry Mortgage was rated above average for mortgage originiation and servicing by J.D. Power, while Guild landed well below-average for mortgage origination. Where Guild really shines is in its online footprint: Borrowers can get preapproval and apply on the easy-to-use website, which has comprehensive information about a wide range of loan options . In contrast, it can be difficult to find information about loan options on the CrossCountry Mortgage website and you must speak with a loan agent by phone to apply or do so in person at a local branch. If you like the comfort of borrowing from home, Rocket Mortgage is the superior choice: You can get current rates, apply and even close remotely (where available). It also has an online chat feature and the customer service phone line is available seven days a week. Rocket is an online-only institution, however, so if you want to work with a loan agent in person, CrossCountry is the way to go. It has over 700 branches nationwide. CrossCountry Mortgage earned respectable rankings for customer satisfaction from J.D. Power, but Rocket ranked No. 1 for mortgage servicing and No. 2 for mortgage origination.  But CrossCountry Mortgage comes out ahead with down payment assistance, with more grant options and wider availability than Rocket.  You can apply for a home loan with  CrossCountry Mortgage  online,  by phone at 877-351-3400 or at one of 700 branches nationwide. On the lender's website, you'll need to create an account and provide basic details, including your ZIP code, phone number and email address. A loan agent will call to guide you through the remainder of the application process and help you upload the required financial documents, including pay stubs, bank statements and tax returns. CrossCountry Mortgage  is a good lender for first-time homebuyers, with a variety of grants and programs offering assistance with a down payment nd closing costs. Since it offers non-qualifying mortgages, it's also an option if you need more flexibility with credit, income or debt-to-income requirements. If you prefer an  online lending experience , however, or want to know fees and rates without having to submit an application, you may want to keep shopping for another mortgage provider.

        "header": "American Airlines in talks to pick Citigroup over rival bank Barclays for crucial credit card deal, sources say ",
        "content": "American Airlines  is in talks to make  Citigroup  its exclusive credit card partner, dropping rival issuer  Barclays  from a partnership that dates back to the airline's 2013 takeover of US Airways, said people with knowledge of the negotiations. American has been working with banks and card networks on a new long-term deal for months with the aim of consolidating its business with a single issuer to boost the revenue haul from its loyalty program, according to the people. Talks are ongoing, and the timing of an agreement, which would be subject to regulatory approval, is unknown, said the people, who declined to be identified speaking about a confidential process. Banks' co-brand deals with airlines, retailers and hotel chains are some of the most hotly contested negotiations in the industry. While they give the issuing bank a captive audience of millions of loyal customers who spend billions of dollars a year, the details of the arrangements can make a huge difference in how profitable it is for either party. Big brands have been driving harder bargains in recent years, demanding a bigger slice of revenue from interest and fees, for example. Meanwhile, banks have been pushing back or  exiting  the space entirely, saying that rising card losses, scrutiny from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and higher capital costs make for tight margins. Airlines rely on card programs to help them stay afloat, earning billions of dollars a year from banks in exchange for miles that customers earn when they use their cards. Those partnerships were  crucial during the pandemic , when travel demand dried up but consumers kept spending and earning miles on their cards. Carriers have said growth in card spending has far exceeded that of passenger  revenue  in recent years. While it says it has the largest loyalty program, American was out-earned by  Delta  there, which made nearly $7 billion in payments from its  American Express  card partnership last year, compared with $5.2 billion for American. \"We continue to work with all of our partners, including our co-branded credit card partners, to explore opportunities to improve the products and services we provide our mutual customers and bring even more value to the AAdvantage program,\" American said in a statement. It's still possible that objections from U.S. regulators,  including  the Department of Transportation, could further delay or even scuttle a contract between American Airlines and Citigroup, leaving the current arrangement that includes Barclays intact, according to one of the people familiar with the process. If the deal between American and Citigroup is consummated, it would end an unusual partnership in the credit card world. Most brands settle with a single issuer, but when American merged with US Airways in 2013, it  kept  longtime issuer Citigroup on board and added US Airways' card partner Barclays. American  renewed  both relationships in 2016, giving each bank specific channels to market their cards. Citi was allowed to pitch its cards online, via direct mail and airport lounges, while Barclays was relegated to on-flight solicitations. When the relationship came up for  renewal  again in the past year, Citigroup had good footing to prevail over the smaller Barclays. Run by CEO  Jane Fraser  since 2021, Citigroup has the more profitable side of the AA business; their customers tend to spend far more and have lower default rates than Barclays customers, one of the people said. Any renewal contract is likely to be seven to 10 years in length, which would give Citigroup time to recoup the costs of porting over Barclays customers and other investments it would need to make, this person said. Banks tend to earn most of the money from these arrangements in the back half of the deals. With this and other large partnerships, Fraser has been pushing Citigroup to aim bigger in a bid to improve the profitability of the card business, said the people familiar.  \"We are always actively working with our partners, including American Airlines, to look for ways to jointly enhance customer products and drive shared value and growth,\" a Citigroup spokesperson told CNBC. Meanwhile, Barclays executives told investors earlier this year that they aimed to diversify their co-branded card portfolio away from airlines, for instance, through added partnerships with retailers and tech companies. Barclays declined to comment for this article."

        "header": "Red-hot refinance demand retreats after tiny bump higher in mortgage rates",
        "content": "Mortgage rates moved ever so slightly higher last week, but it was enough to take a little heat out of what had been a briefly red-hot refinance market. That caused total mortgage application volume to fall 1.3% for the week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index.  The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) increased to 6.14% from 6.13%, with points rising to 0.61 from 0.57 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. The rate was 139 basis points higher the same week one year ago. \"Last week's incoming data showed an economy that is still growing at a solid pace, even as inflation continues to decline. As a result, mortgage rates were up modestly,\" said Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist at the MBA, in a release. Applications to refinance a home loan fell 3% for the week but were still a striking 186% higher than the same week one year ago. The vast majority of borrowers today have mortgages with rates well below 5%, but those who may have purchased a home in the past year or two might be able to benefit from a refinance to today's lower rates. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 1% for the week and were 9% higher than the same week one year ago. The fall market does appear to be warming up a little bit, with real estate brokerages like Redfin reporting more home tours in the last few weeks. Some buyers, however, may be sitting on the sidelines, expecting rates to move even lower in the coming months. \"Inventories of both new and existing homes have been increasing over the course of 2024, meaning that potential buyers have properties to look at and now have somewhat lower mortgage rates leading to better affordability,\" Fratantoni added.  Mortgage rates moved very slightly lower again to start this week, as bond yields dipped following escalation in the Middle East conflict. The next big move in interest rates could come Friday, with the release of the all-important monthly employment report."

        "header": "What economists say about JD Vance's claim that immigrants drive up housing costs",
        "content": "America's two vice presidential candidates agreed Tuesday night that America is in the midst of a housing crisis in which too few homes and steady demand have led to soaring costs. But Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz presented radically different views of how the country got there and how to fix the problem. Housing is one of many issues Vance, the Republican nominee, believes are rooted in the arrival of undocumented migrants in America. \"Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes,\" Vance said, according to a CBS News transcript. Along with zoning reform, Vance and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump have premised much of their policy on an unprecedented mass-deportation plan that they argue would reduce competition for housing. Read more from NBC News: Walz, the Democratic nominee, said the reasons for America's housing crisis are more nuanced. \"We can't blame immigrants for the only reason,\" he said. \"The fact of the matter is that we don't have enough naturally affordable housing, but we can make sure that the government's there to help kick-start it, create that, create that base.\" Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, hope to use tax incentives and spending to spur housing construction and ease the financial burden of buying a home. Housing is expensive in the U.S.: The NBC News Home Buyer Difficulty Index remains extremely high , and shelter costs continue to account for the majority of consumer inflation, having climbed more than 24% since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Rents have climbed even faster. But many economists caution that connecting rising numbers of immigrants to housing costs is no simple thing. Some have said there is no way to examine existing data and surveys in real time to determine the extent of immigrants' impact on individual housing markets  though a chart drawn up by Ernie Tedeschi, a former White House chief economist for President Joe Biden, showed no clear connection between foreign-born population growth and native-born home prices on a national scale. Other economists have noted links between immigrants and increased housing costs. After the debate, Vance's X account shared a link to remarks by Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, who said that \"the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize\"  though in the same speech, she said immigrants had also helped ease labor shortages. Vance later shared two studies on housing and immigration that showed a link between increased immigration and rising housing costs  though each offered various caveats, including noting that the impact changes over time.  On Wednesday, the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, published a blog post titled \"JD Vance Is Correct: Immigration Increases Housing Prices, and That's Okay,\" arguing that while rising immigrant populations do lead to increased housing costs, \"most of the increase in housing wealth caused by immigration accrues to native-born Americans\" and that immigrants also increase the overall housing supply thanks to their outsized ranks in the construction industry.  But in general, economists are skeptical that immigrants are the main driver of the current predicament. Chris Herbert, managing director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, said that while immigrants do add to overall housing demand, \"they cannot be blamed for the recent surge in home prices and rents that took off in 2020 and 2021.\" That was when immigration reached its lowest levels in decades because of the pandemic, he said in a statement emailed to news outlets. When immigration started to surge in 2022 and peaked in 2023, Herbert said, \"growth in home prices and rents slowed dramatically.\" \"Trends in interest rates and the pandemic-induced demand for housing were mostly responsible for the recent trends in housing costs,\" he added. Historically, immigrants have tended to coalesce in depopulated or underused towns or neighborhoods without directly competing with native-born residents, said Sharon Cornelissen, director of housing for the Consumer Federation of America, which advocates for equitable housing policies. She cited immigrant inflows that helped revitalize New York City and Los Angeles in the 1970s and the 1980s cities as they were dealing with the aftermath of white flight. Middle Eastern populations have also been responsible for helping turn around the cities of Dearborn and Hamtramck outside Detroit, she said. There is evidence that more recent immigrant influxes have proven difficult to handle for the communities where they have arrived. In Brockton, Massachusetts, immigrants from a variety of countries, including Haiti, Cape Verde and countries in Central and South America, have strained local resources  though mostly in the form of emergency shelter capacity. NBC Boston reported this summer that immigrant-focused nonprofit groups have been helping place newly arrived families in motels and that they also tapped partnerships with private landlords to set up others in apartments. Housing problems predate the immigration surge in Springfield, Ohio, which has become a flashpoint in the national immigration debate, City Manager Bryan Heck said in a letter to Vance and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown this summer. But Heck acknowledged the migrants had played a part in complicating the situation. \"Most recently, Springfield has seen a surge in population through immigration that has significantly impacted our ability as a community to produce enough housing opportunities for all,\" Heck wrote, estimating the city's Haitian population had increased to 15,000 to 20,000 over the last four years in a community of just under 60,000 residents. The growth, he said, put a \"significant\" strain on the city's ability to provide housing for all residents. Indeed, Zillow data shows a clear upward trend in Springfield rents this year compared with 2023. \"Despite 2,000 additional housing units set to come online over the next three to five years, this is still not enough,\" Heck said. His demand? More aid from Washington. \"Without further support at the Federal level, communities like Springfield are set up to fail in being able to meet the housing needs of its residents,\" he wrote."

The real estate sector was the biggest gainer in the  Hang Seng Index , with Longfor Group Holdings  being the top mover, adding over 25%. Shares of other real estate developers also saw significant gains.

Hang Lung Properties  and  China Resources Land  gained 12.65% and 7.68% respectively. The wider Hang Seng Index added 5.46%, while the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index surged over 11.69%. Mainland Chinese markets are closed for the Golden Week holiday. Over the weekend , major cities in mainland China introduced easing measures to enhance homebuyer confidence, following a series of policy stimulus initiatives from the central bank last Tuesday. Guangzhou's city government  announced that all restrictions on home purchases would be removed starting Monday. Shanghai's reduction of the required tax-paying period also came into effect on Tuesday. Shenzhen has also relaxed purchasing restrictions, allowing buyers to purchase one more apartment in select districts. \"Investors are betting that the recent policy relaxation will lead to a home market recovery, which should help developers with sales and prices,\" Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told CNBC. Still, he sees challenges with these expectations materializing into reality, especially with inventory pressure in non-tier one cities. \"If home sales do not improve in the next few weeks, it can go back to square one,\" he said. While these measures will help stabilize the property market, lifting prices and reviving demand will be a tall order, Morgan Stanley wrote in a note published Wednesday. \"The continued drag from the property sector will leave a sizable shortfall in demand behind, keeping growth below target,\" the investment bank's Asia-Pacific economists wrote. Real estate  used to account for over 25% of China's GDP , but it has faced a prolonged decline since 2020 following Beijing's crackdown on the sector's excessive debt. Chinese officials have ramped up support to alleviate financial pressures on households and stabilize the embattled real estate market. However, these previous initiatives have not resulted in significant turnarounds. \"There are more signs of stabilization, but it does not change the fact that China's real estate sector has entered the twilight of the fast-growth era,\" said Ng."

        "content": "Singapore's private home prices fell for the first time in five quarters amid depressed sales,  preliminary market data  showed on Tuesday. The data released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority showed that its private home price index fell 1.1% last quarter as compared to the previous three months. The fall reversed gains from the second quarter and represented the index's first drop since the second quarter of 2023. In total, prices were up only 1.1% in the first three quarters of 2024 compared with a 3.9% gain over the same period the prior year. Sales transaction volume also fell by about 11% in the third quarter from the previous three months. For the first three quarters of 2024, sales transactions were down 8.1% from a year ago. \"While macroeconomic conditions remain sound, the economic outlook is subject to uncertainties, and market sentiments continue to be sensitive to geopolitical developments and global interest rate changes,\" the authority said. Some buyers may have held off on home purchases in the third quarter in anticipation of the U.S. Federal Reserve's  September interest rate cut. However, the authority said that despite the Fed's rate cuts, Singapore's mortgage rates are expected to remain elevated relative to the low levels experienced over the past ten years. \"Households should continue to exercise prudence when purchasing properties and taking on mortgage loans,\" it added. The Urban Redevelopment Authority's estimates were based on contract prices and data on units sold by real estate developers up until mid-September. The authority will release a more complete set of property statistics for the third quarter on Oct. 25. Meanwhile, resale prices of Housing and Development Board flats in Singapore were up 2.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous one, according to  HDB flash estimates  also released Tuesday. HDB resale volumes were up 20% quarter-on-quarter. In Singapore, more than 80% of residents live in public housing flats, which are built, sold and subsidized by the government. Local authorities  recently introduced measures  to cool the public housing market. \"The government will continue to monitor the property market closely and adjust its policies as necessary to promote a stable and sustainable property market,\" HDB said."

        "content": "New rules on buying and selling homes are in play, now that a settlement from a  class-action lawsuit  has taken effect. In March , the National Association of Realtors  agreed  to a $418 million settlement in an antitrust lawsuit where a federal jury found the organization and several large real-estate brokerages had conspired to artificially inflate agent commissions on the sale and purchase of real estate. In a statement at the time of the verdict, the NAR  denied  wrongdoing. The settlement took effect on August 17. Prior to the settlement, the NAR's multiple listing service, or MLS, used at a local level across areas in the U.S., facilitated the compensation rates for both a buyer's and seller's agents. At the time of listing a property, the home seller negotiated with the listing agent what the compensation would be for a buyer's agent, which appeared on the MLS. However, if a seller was unaware they could negotiate, they were typically locked into paying the listed brokerage fee. More from Personal Finance: How to avoid getting bad money advice from TikTok It's not a great fall housing market, but it's 'as good as it gets' Here's when you can't refinance a mortgage to capitalize on lower rates Now, as a result of the settlement, the commission rates are officially removed from the MLS and home sellers are no longer obligated to offer commission for both the buyer and seller agents. \"Now, the buyer chooses how much the buyer's agent makes, the sellers choose how much the seller's agents make,\" Glenn Kelman, CEO of online real estate brokerage firm Redfin, told CNBC. \"It's a new competitive ballgame.\" Any confusion around the new practices among agents and consumers will likely be temporary, said Kerry Melcher, head of real estate at Opendoor. \"Real estate agents are good at moving the market,\" she said. \"That's their job. So, I don't believe that this is going to slow down the market.\" Here's what to know. Potential homebuyers might come across inconsistencies in the market as real estate agents grow accustomed to the new rules. Before August 17, if you called five buyer agents for the same inquiry related to buying a home, \"four out of five times,\" you would get the same answer, said real estate attorney Claudia Cobreiro, the founder of Cobreiro Law in Coral Gables, Florida. \"Now, maybe two out of five times, you're going to get the same answer,\" Cobreiro said. That's because real estate agents are receiving different instructions from their brokerage firm on how to implement the NAR settlement changes, and it's translating into confusion among consumers, she said. Meanwhile on the listing side, real estate agents are educating home sellers on the benefits of offering commission to the buyer's agent even if it's not a set amount or percentage, Cobreiro explained. For instance, offering a commission can create more competition for agents wanting to show their property, which increases the sales price, she said. \"Explaining those benefits of still offering commission despite the fact that the commission is not mandatory is part of the job that now I'm seeing listing agents do,\" said Cobreiro. The buyer-broker agreement is a contract between a real estate agent and a homebuyer that specifies the terms of their working relationship, said Cobreiro  the goal of which is to identify a house for the buyer to purchase. If the client buys a property that meets the criteria in the agreement within the specified timeframe, the agent is entitled to the commission for that purchase, Cobreiro said. \"The purpose of this form is telling the buyers they are responsible for their own commission on the buyer's side,\" she said. If the seller does not offer commission, the buyer would be responsible for whatever commission was listed on that buyer broker agreement, Cobreiro said. Buyers must get comfortable with what buyer-broker agreement forms look like and be prepared to ask questions about the language and terms, Melcher said. \"The forms are designed to be read by buyers and for buyers to understand them,\" she said. CNBC associate producer Ryan Baker contributed to this story."

        "content": "LONDON  Lower  mortgage rates  are sparking an uptick in the U.K. housing market, following a surge in the pace of home sales last month, data showed. Agreed home sales rose by 25% year-on-year in the four weeks to Sept. 22, marking the fastest pace of growth since spring 2021, \"as households that have held off making moving decisions over the last 2 years return to the market,\" according to research published Thursday by property portal Zoopla. Home buyer inquiries also increased by 26% annually over the same period, the data shows. Shares of U.K. homebuilders  Taylor Wimpey  and  Barratt Developments  both rose more than 2.1% following the data release. It comes as house  prices ticked up  at their fastest pace in almost two years in September, according to Nationwide, rising 3.2% year-on-year from 2.4% in August, when lenders began  slashing borrowing costs  in response to the Bank of England's  first interest rate cut  in over four years. Mortgages rates have now fallen to an average of 4.57% for a five-year fixed term, down from 5.53% last year, according to the latest  data  compiled by property portal Rightmove. Some rates for such products have dipped to 3.7%, well below the BoE's 5% key rate. \"Lower mortgage rates are delivering a much-needed confidence boost to homeowners, many of whom have sat on the sidelines over the past two years,\" said Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, said in the report. Mortgage approvals rose in August to the highest level in two years in years, the Bank of England  said Monday . Market watchers are now awaiting the BOE's Nov. 7 meeting for further movement on borrowing costs, with Governor Andrew Bailey telling the Guardian Thursday that the Bank could be a  \"bit more aggressive\"  on rate cuts if inflation data continued to be good. House price growth was most pronounced in Northern Ireland (8.6%) and Scotland (4.3%) on an annual quarterly basis, while the north of England outpaced the south, according to Nationwide data. Nevertheless, London remained the best performing southern region, notching a 2% price growth. Apartment sales continue to lag in the post-pandemic \"race for space,\" however, Nationwide's Chief Economist Robert Gardner noticed. More such stock has been coming to the market, as  landlords look to sell  their buy-to-let properties ahead of anticipated tax hikes in the Labour government's upcoming Oct 30. Autumn budget. Donnell said that was likely to keep price growth in check over the coming months, as more owners of second properties come to the market. \"Speculation over possible tax changes in the Budget and the impact of previous tax changes are continuing to add to the growth in the number of homes for sale. We remain in a buyers market and greater choice of homes for sale will keep house price inflation in check into 2025,\" he noted. Finance Minister Rachel Reeveshas suggested that she will likely have to raise taxes after discovering a 22 billion ($29 billion) \"black hole\" in the public finances. Having ruled out changes to income tax, National Insurance social security payments and value-added tax (a sales levy), increases to capital gains tax and inheritance tax  both of which impact property sales  remain on the table. Meanwhile, possible changes to the country's controversial non-dom tax status is also spurring seller activity at the top end of the market, as ultra-wealthy U.K. residents weigh moves to other lower tax locations."

REA said it maintains a \"disciplined approach\" to mergers and acquisitions and that it's bid for Rightmove was dependent on coming to an agreement at a \"fair price.\" \"We were disappointed with the limited engagement from Rightmove that impeded our ability to make a firm offer within the timetable available. They had nothing to lose by engaging with us,\" said REA's CEO Owen Wilson. Rightmove, meanwhile, said Monday in a separate statement that its board unanimously rejected REA Group's fourth offer proposal on the grounds that it \"materially undervalued Rightmove and its future prospects.\" It added that shareholder interests would be better served through the execution of Rightmove's standalone strategic plan. The offer, made on Friday, for 346 pence in cash and 0.0417 new REA shares, implied an additional 10 pence in value or 1.3%, when compared to the previous third proposal, according to Rightmove. Shares of Rightmove traded 8.3% lower at 613p as of 3:15 p.m. London time. REA Group's latest offer implied a total offer value of 780p, based on the closing price of REA Group on Sept. 30, according to Rightmove. The Australian property listings company, which is controlled by Murdoch's News Corp , first announced it was  contemplating a takeover  of Rightmove at the start of September. It's final bid of around 6 billion ($8.1 billion), according to Reuters, came after an initial offer of 5.6 billion. Before Melbourne-headquartered REA Groupconfirmed it was abandoning its proposals for Rightmove, the U.K. firm had urged REA to submit a final proposal to bring an end to the uncertainty from the bidding process. \"The last few weeks have been very disruptive, as well as unsettling for our colleagues,\" said Rightmove's Chair Andrew Fisher. REA Group, in which News Corp owns a more than 61% interest, operates a number of property websites in Australia, as well as several brands in India and the U.S. The company's previous venture into the U.K. faced stiff market pressure. The company sold its real estate site PropertyFinder Group to Rightmove rival Zoopla in 2009, during the Global Financial Crisis.  CNBC's Karen Gilchrest contributed to this story."

        "content": "Shares of Chinese property developers rallied on Monday after major cities in mainland China unveiled easing measures to boost homebuyer sentiment, following the central bank's blitz of policy stimulus. The  Guangzhou city government  said in a notice on Sunday that all restrictions on home purchases would be removed, effective from Monday. Previously, migrant families were required to pay taxes or social insurance for at least six months in order to purchase up to two homes, while single individuals were limited to one apartment. The  Shanghai government also lowered  the required tax-paying period to one year from three years. The city also lowered the down-payment ratio for first homes to around 15%, while second homes to about 25%, above the nation's average ratio of 15%. The rules take effect starting Tuesday, according to the notice late Sunday. Shenzhen's government also relaxed  purchasing restrictions  which had capped local families to two homes and single individuals to one  allowing buyers to purchase one more apartment in certain districts. Migrant families with at least two children can now buy two homes, instead of one previously, according to the statement. After markets closed,  Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-rural Development  issued a directive to bring down the city's existing mortgage rates and down-payment ratio closer to levels set by the central bank last week. The down-payment ratio for second homes need to be \"no lower than 20%,\" the city said. The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index climbed 7% on Monday, extending last week's gain of more than 30%. Hong Kong-listed shares of real estate developers like  Longfor Group Holdings ,  Hang Lung Properties ,  China Resources Land  were some of the biggest movers on the Hang Seng index, gaining 12.4%, 12.7% and 2.5%, respectively.  China Overseas Land & Investment  and  China Vanke  climbed 3.5% and 11.7%, giving back some of the gains in the morning session. Mainland China's CSI 300 surged 8.5% Monday, after the index logged its best week in almost 16 years on Friday. The CSI 300 Real Estate index jumped over 9%. Easing purchase restrictions may help lift property sales in the first-tier cities  like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou  by a greater margin than other cities, said Allen Feng, an associate director at Rhodium Group, pointing out that similar measures had not worked in other cities previously. The view is shared by Gary Ng, APAC economist atNatixis, who suggests the effect more limited in smaller cities \"given the elevated inventory level.\" They are more likely to lead to some \"stabilization\" rather than a turnaround, Ng said. The easing measures follow the central government's call last week to combat the property slump . Authorities \"must work to halt the real estate market decline and spur a stable recovery,\" according to CNBC's translation of the Chinese readout of the high-level meeting, chaired by President Xi Jinping. The People's Bank of China  also reduced the interest rates  on existing individual mortgages by an average of 0.5 percentage points, and lowered the average down-payment ratio for second homes purchases to 15% from 25%. Real estate once contributed more than a quarter of China's GDP, but entered a multi-year downturn after Beijing's crackdown on the sector's high levels of debt in 2020. Chinese policymakers have been ramping up support to reduce household's financial burden and shore up the troubled real estate sector. But the previous measures have not led to any meaningful turnarounds. China may \"need to accelerate its efforts at completing stalled or abandoned construction projects of pre-sold properties\" in order to shore up confidence among potential homebuyers and restore demand, said Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank Investment Banking Group, noting that only 4% of the floor space under construction this year have been completed. \"Swift follow-up of fiscal policies\" is crucial, Nomura analysts led by Jizhou Dong said in a note on Sept. 26, and \"if introduced soon enough\" they would act as tailwinds to stimulate domestic consumption and stabilize the property sector. Homebuyer demand would slowly bottom out and mortgage loan growth is expected to stop contracting soon, Natixis' Ng said, \"but it will take longer, and measures in larger magnitude to see a sharp overall rebound in the property market.\""

        "header": "6 strategies to help mitigate rising car and home insurance costs",
        "content": "Join us on October 24th at 1pm for an online Your Money event:   REGISTER HERE The cost of insuring your most expensive assets  has skyrocketed . While overall inflation has slowed, insurance costs are taking a bigger bite out of many household budgets. The average annual rate for  homeowners insurance  increased by nearly 20% between 2021 and 2023  and homeowners can expect another 6% increase in 2024, according to Insurify, a virtual insurance agent.That would bring the average policy cost to $2,522 by the end of the year. Car insurance premiums have also shot up. The average cost of motor vehicle insurance  jumped 16.5%  from August 2023 to August 2024, according to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Bankrate estimates that in September the average cost for full coverage car insurance is $2,348 a year. Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. Several factors contribute to climbing home insurance rates, including increasing costs for homebuilding supplies and repairs, a significant rise in litigation around claims, and the greater frequency of weather-related events, said Shannon Martin, a licensed insurance agent and writer for Bankrate. Extreme weather events, higher replacement and repair costs, and increased medical expenses after accidents have boosted car insurance rates, experts say. Still, there are ways to mitigate rising premiums. Here are six strategies to consider: Consider switching to another insurance company. While most people stick with their car or home insurer from year to year, it's wise to shop around, experts say. About 37% of drivers say they will or have already received a quote from a new insurer in response to rising insurance rates, and 27% have or plan to switch insurance companies, according to a  new survey  by Autoinsurance.com. Shop around for car and home insurance once a year to make sure the rates you're paying now are still competitive, experts say. You might also want to compare rates if you have a life change that could affect your rate. \"If you move, get married or buy a new car, that's also a good time to shop around,\" said Maya Afilalo, an insurance analyst at Autoinsurance.com. Even though extreme weather events have  adversely impacted many insurers , companies are at different stages with how they have adjusted. \"So a company that you may be with now that may have a much higher rate than a company that's kind of already in a recovery stage,\" said insurance agent Mike Barrett, who owns the Barrett Insurance Agency in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. \"Shopping could really save you some money.\" Compare costs by getting quotes from a few insurers before renewing your policy. You can go online or use apps for insurance marketplaces to get quotes from several companies at once. Or you may want to talk with an independent insurance agent  doing so is typically free, because they usually get a commission from the insurer for selling you a policy. You can find an agent in your area through the  Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America.  Lower premiums aren't the only factor to consider. Check out AM Best and Demotech, which rate insurers' financial strength and reliability. \"What you're looking for is the financial strength of the carrier, which shows their ability to pay future claims, and also understanding what their history of paying claims has been in the past,\" said insurance agent David Carothers, a principal at Florida Risk Partners in Valrico, Florida. Your deductible is the amount of money you will have to  pay out of pocket  before the insurance company steps in. Raising your deductible can lower your car and home insurance premiums. With car insurance, for example, \"increasing your deductible from $500 to $1,000 can reduce optional collision and coverage premium costs by 15% to 20%,\" said Loretta Worters, a vice president at the Insurance Information Institute. But if you raise your deductible, you need to have  enough money in an emergency fund  to cover it. If you've been with the same insurance company for several years, you may have made changes that better protect your home from hazards  for example, a new roof, hurricane-impact windows or a security system  since taking out the policy. Updating your coverage to reflect those changes could save you money, experts say. Reducing coverage on certain items, like jewelry or artwork, could also lower your homeowners premium. Dropping collision and/or comprehensive coverage on older cars can also cut costs. You may want to consider dropping coverage if your car's value is worth less than 10 times the premium, according to the Insurance Information Institute. But that means you'll have to pay for any damages out of pocket if you're in an accident or your car sustains damage due to weather, theft or another noncollision event. \"You might be responsible for paying for those damages to other property that isn't covered by your insurance company. So you know, there's some risk and reward there,\" said Rod Griffin, a senior director at Experian. That said, experts say having enough insurance and the right kind of coverage may save you more money in the long run. Saving on premiums may ultimately be costly if you don't have the type of insurance you need, such as flood insurance. Just an inch of water can cause roughly $25,000 of damage to a property, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Yet, most homeowners insurance  explicitly excludes flood damage , and few people pursue that coverage. On average, about 30% of U.S. homes in the highest-risk areas for flooding have flood insurance,  according  to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Risk Center. Experts say you may need flood insurance even if you're not in a high-risk zone. \"A lot of people don't buy it because their bank doesn't require them to and then all of a sudden, a hurricane comes. They're not in a flood zone, according to a map, and we have a storm surge, and there's all kinds of uncovered claims,\" said Carothers of Florida Risk Partners. One of the most touted discounts is bundling coverage. You've likely seen many ads about purchasing home and car insurance from the same insurer to save money, but experts say that's not always the case. You may find better rates using different companies. \"It's really good to investigate both angles  bundling, not bundling  and always talk to your agent before you make big changes to your home or expensive changes that you think are going to save you money,\" Bankrate's Martin said. Homeowners may get discounts for going claim-free for a certain period of time, or installing features that  better protect their home  from hazards. Car insurance discounts range from safe driver and good student discounts to taking a defensive driving course. There are also discounts for older drivers and low mileage discounts for driving fewer miles than the average. Your credit history can also  impact auto and home insurance rates . The higher your credit rating, the less you may pay for insurance in states where credit is a rating factor for insurance companies, experts say. Having poor credit can significantly increase your insurance costs. For example, drivers with poor credit for full coverage insurance pay $4,349 a year compared with drivers with excellent credit who pay $2,033, according to  a  Bankrate  report . Factor insurance costs into your housing or car budget from the start.Pricing policies out early can help you avoid sticker shock at a point where it's tougher to back out of a purchase. Also, when you're buying a home, consider the likelihood of extreme weather for a prospective property, which can mean you have a  more limited choice of insurers  and face higher prices for coverage. Some websites, like  First Street  and  Climate Check,  can give you a projection of the impact of extreme weather events on your home through 2050. \"You're always putting yourself in a stronger position to price out your insurance before you get emotionally and financially involved,\" Martin said.

        "content": "Shares of Hong Kong's New World Development surged following the  resignation of Adrian Cheng, a member of the founding family . Hong Kong listed shares of the major development company traded 23% higher after trading resumed on Friday. The company said in a statement that it  halted trading on Thursday  \"pending the release of announcements\" following the departure of Cheng, who will be devoting more time to \"public services and other personal commitments.\" In his stead, Chief Operating Officer Eric Ma Siu-Cheung has been appointed as the new CEO, the company announced, marking a rare move for an outsider to lead the family business in Hong Kong. The developer,  in a filing last month , said it expected to record a loss attributive to shareholders of HK $19 billion ($2.4 billion)  to HK $20 billion ($2.6 billion) for the financial year ended in June , dragged by declining sales, investment losses and impairment charges. New World's woes come as property pains continue to plague Hong Kong and mainland China. The developer's statements indicate that it is also burdened by elevated debt levels. \"This is clearly showing that corporate governance does matter. Having all of these tycoons with their preferred sons or daughters, mostly sons, is not really the way to run these companies,\" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, an investment banking company, told CNBC. \"And I think by now, tycoons in Asia, especially Hong Kong tycoons, realized that when markets are tough, it's really hard to to do well, unless you have the best management,\" she added. The economist added that the key drivers for New World's surging shares are also owed to the stimulus measures coming out of China. The rally comes amid a broader rally in Hong Kong and Chinese equities in recent sessions following the slate of stimulus measures announced by China's central bank on Tuesday. China's top leaders also declared on Thursday  that authorities must work to halt the real estate market decline. A readout of their meeting indicated that leaders urged for enhanced fiscal and monetary policy support, addressing a range of topics including employment and the ageing population."

The real estate sector of the S & P 500 has been moving higher over the past month or so and is now up 10% year to date, after being in the red earlier this year. The sector hit a 52-week high last week. Real estate investment trusts are also an income play, often paying out attractive dividends. \"Stocks with healthy yields become increasingly attractive in a Fed cutting environment,\" Jill Carey Hall, an equity and quant strategist at the bank, wrote in a Sept. 9 note that focused on small-cap and midcap REITs. Her work with small-cap and midcap stocks also suggests that dividend yield is the best factor to hedge cycle risk, she added. .SPLRCR YTD mountain S & P 500 Real Estate Sector The Federal Reserve started its rate-cutting cycle last week, slashing the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. The central bank also indicated another 50 basis points of cuts by the end of the year. In this environment, Bank of America likes health care, residential and retail REITs. Health-care real estate is a play on the aging of America , which will see more people seeking medical services and senior housing, Hall said. Residential REITs continue to see demand given housing affordability issues and a majority of retail REITs have beat and raised guidance, she added. When it comes to choosing specific stocks, analyst Jeffrey Spector, the bank's head of U.S. REITs, suggests looking at names with quality growth, quality value and  with the anticipation of a soft-landing scenario  quality risk. \"Higher quality REITs will offer the best earnings and distribution growth,\" he wrote in the same note. Quality REITs have resilient pricing power, multiyear earnings visibility based on secular growth drivers, strong and flexible balance sheets and the highest prospect for global inflows. Here are some of the names that made Spector's top picks list. Welltower is the only large-cap stock that made the cut. The rest are small-cap and midcap REITs. Welltower owns and develops senior housing, skilled nursing/post-acute care facilities and medical office buildings. Near term, Welltower will benefit the most from accelerating occupancy gains amid the post-Covid recovery, Bank of America believes. \"In addition, we believe senior housing rate growth will remain robust in 2024 & beyond. WELL has the highest exposure to senior housing operating assets within our coverage universe and based on our demographic analysis has the best positioned portfolio,\" the bank said. \"Longer term, demographic trends are favorable as baby boomers continue to age.\" Shares of Welltower are up 40% year to date. Mid-America Apartment Communities and American Homes 4 Rent are both residential housing plays. The former is a multifamily REIT that operates in communities across the Sunbelt region, where the bank sees robust job growth and a lower cost of living. The latter owns the second-largest single-family rental REIT portfolio in the U.S., Spector wrote. \"We remain positive on AMH's portfolio, limited new supply of single-family homes, structural demographic tailwinds with aging millennials, accretive consolidation/development opportunities, and a strong management,\" he said. Mid-America Apartment Communities has gained nearly 18% year to date, while American Homes 4 Rent is up close to 7%. Lastly, Federal Realty Investment Trust owns, operates and develops retail-based properties in coastal markets. Spector said this \"blue-chip retail REIT\" has a diverse portfolio of shopping centers and should produce growth above its peers in the long term. The stock has moved more than 9% higher so far this year."

Residential and commercial buildings  account for  31% of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, after accounting for \"indirect\" emissions like electricity use, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That's more than other economic sectors like transportation and agriculture. The Biden administration has adopted various policies to cut residential emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act,  enacted in 2022 , offers financial benefits including  tax breaks  and  rebates  to homeowners who make their homes more energy-efficient, for example. The White House also recently  issued guidelines for buildings  in order to be considered \" zero emissions ,\" meaning they are \"energy efficient, free of onsite emissions from energy use and powered solely from clean energy,\" according to the Department of Energy. More from Personal Finance: How EVs and gasoline cars compare on total cost Here's how to buy renewable energy from your electric utility 8 easy  and cheap  ways to cut your carbon emissions Morgan Wojciechowski, 33, is among the first homeowners to get that federal \"zero emissions\" label. (That assessment was bestowed by the third-party firm  Pearl Certification .) Wojciechowski, her husband Casey, and their three dogs  Dixie, Bo and Charlie  moved into the  newly built residence  in Williamsburg, Virginia, in August 2023. Wojciechowski, who is also the president of Healthy Communities, a local real-estate developer focused on sustainable construction, spoke with CNBC about her new home, its financial benefits and how consumers can best upgrade their homes to be more efficient. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Greg Iacurci: What does it mean for your home to be considered 'zero emissions'? Morgan Wojciechowski:  It's a very, very, very highly efficient home that's all-electric. Those are kind of the first two bullet points of the White House definition. The third part is we are  part of the green energy program  with [our power provider] Dominion. Not only am I producing solar [energy] and any excess is going back onto the grid, but the power from the grid coming into my home is clean and sustainable. It's about $10 extra a month for me to get that clean energy. GI: How much did your house cost to build? MW:  Like $1.1 million. GI: And how big is the house? MW:  5,400 square feet. It's a large home. But mine is not what everybody's doing. My home was my personal project because I believe in sustainability and wanted to do it in a home that would be my forever home. But one that's more replicable would be like what [Healthy Communities] builds at  Walnut Farm , which is like 1,500 square feet. We're selling it for $433,000. GI: Can you break down your home's estimated savings? MW:  Our utility bills are projected to be about $917 a year with [solar] panels, or around $80 a month. The annual savings are $7,226 [relative to an average U.S. home, according to rater TopBuild Home Services]. That's just from the efficiency of the home with solar. If you took the solar production away, I would be saving $5,431 annually. The solar offsets it. GI: What do you mean solar offsets it? MW:  You create energy. Your home uses that energy and sends excess energy back to Dominion. Those credits are stored in an account, and then those credits offset your bill. It's called net metering. GI: So the power company is paying you that money? MW:  Those credits are applied to your next billing cycle. They offset your overall utility bill, and that's where your savings come in. Solar panels only make sense if you build an energy-efficient home that's really all-electric. GI: Why is that? MW:  You have to have a home that's constructed energy-efficiently enough or retrofitted  by replacing your windows with higher-grade windows, adding insulation  so that you will need fewer panels on your rooftop, so you have a quicker return on your investment. Solar only makes sense if you're going to have a return on your investment within a few years. GI: That makes solar more attractive? MW:  If you don't do energy-efficient upgrades to a pre-existing home or if you don't build a home that's energy-efficient enough, you have to add more panels to compensate for the lack of energy efficiency. And if that number gets too big it turns people upside down. Solar has to make sense with the home that you're putting it on, or else, don't do it. Maybe just upgrade your windows, add insulation, condition your crawl space, upgrade your mechanical systems. There are a lot of things consumers can do. You don't have to do it all at one time. You don't have to have a solar home to be zero emissions; you have to have an energy-efficient house that's all-electric, and you have to buy renewable energy from your utility company. That's extremely approachable. Lots of people can do that. Everybody can join in at their level of sustainability. GI: How do you recommend people get started? MW:  I would tell a consumer, why don't you start with windows and doors. That's a very easy one. Do that and see how you notice any [efficiency] changes. In a lot of older homes windows are very old and they leak. Air is coming in and out. If you think about it, a house is like an envelope. You you want to seal the inside of your home the best that you can.  I would hit insulation next. A lot of older homes have HVAC systems, duct work inside of their attic. Insulate it so that it's a conditioned space, so that those building systems don't have to work in overdrive to keep up with really hot temperatures or really cold temperatures. That keeps it more energy efficient. And there are  tax incentives  [available] for energy-efficient upgrades to your home. Consumers can get and write them off, so that's attractive to people as well. GI: If you're a renter, there are certain things that are out of your control. I suppose you can ask your landlord. MW:  Depending upon what your rental situation is. I feel like that's a little bit more daunting, to change someone else's mind. Once you get to your own home, eventually, then you have more say of what you can do. Until then, you could be mindful about the energy you use. Turn lights off. I mean, that's a real thing. People don't turn lights off. I mean, even though I have a really efficient home, I have timers on things because I don't want to be wasting energy. That's  an easy one  that anybody could do. Correction: The house is 5,400 square feet. An earlier version misstated the figure."

        "header": "It's not a great fall housing market, but this is 'as good as it gets,' economist says",
        "content": "While housing affordability remains a challenge for many buyers in the U.S., conditions are somewhat improving due to lower mortgage rates. Buyers need to earn $115,000 to afford the typical home in the U.S.,  according  to a new report by Redfin, an online real estate brokerage firm. That's down 1% from a year ago, and represents the first decline since 2020. Housing payments posted the biggest decline in four years,  Redfin also found . The median mortgage payment was $2,534 during the four weeks ending Sept. 15, down 2.7% from a year ago. Both declines stem from lower mortgage rates, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. As of Sept. 19, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage is 6.09%, down from 6.20% a week prior,  according  to Freddie Mac data via the Fed. Rates peaked this year at 7.22% on May 2. \"The only reason mortgage payments are down is because of the rate effect,\" Fairweather said. More from Personal Finance: When to refinance your mortgage as the Federal Reserve cuts rates 401(k)-to-IRA rollovers have a 'billion-dollar blind spot,' Vanguard finds What the first interest rate cut in years means for your wallet Challenges remain: The typical household earns 27% less than what they need to afford a home, about $84,000 a year, per Redfin data. Home prices are still high, too. The median asking price for newly listed homes for sale is $398,475, up 5.4% from a year ago, Redfin found. While housing overall continues to be unaffordable for most buyers, \"this is as good as it gets,\" said Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow, as the market is generally seeing lower mortgage rates, more inventory and low buyer competition. Here's what buyers can expect in the coming months. Lower home loan rates provide \"a great opportunity for buyers who have been waiting,\" Divounguy said. Just because the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, it doesn't \"necessarily guarantee mortgage rates will continue to fall,\" he said. While mortgage rates are partly influenced by the Fed's policy, they are also tied to Treasury yields and other economic data . \"Mortgage rates will go by the way of the economy,\" said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage in New York. \"If the economy shows signs of weakening ... rates will come down,\" Cohn said. \"If we see the opposite, and that the economy is chugging along and employment gets stronger, it's quite possible that rates will go up.\" On top of lower mortgage rates, a higher inventory of homes for sale makes the housing market more favorable for buyers, said Divounguy. There were 1,350,000 homes for sale by the end of August, up 0.7% from a month prior,  according  to the National Association of Realtors. That inventory level was up 22.7% compared with August 2023. Meanwhile, homebuilder confidence in the market for newly built single family homes improved in September,  according  to the National Association of Home Builders, or NAHB. Its survey also shows that the share of builders cutting prices in September was 32%, down one point. It's the first decline since April, according to NAHB. \"That tells me that some builders are probably starting to see some increase in foot traffic,\" said Divounguy, and that the market could get competitive again. Price growth will depend on the level of existing home inventory, said Robert Dietz, chief economist at NAHB. \"Existing home inventory is expected to rise as the mortgage rate lock-in effect diminishes, placing some downward pressure on prices as well,\" Dietz said. The housing market is not going to get generally worse over the next 12 months, said Fairweather. If house hunters are discouraged because they haven't found a home, they might have a better chance next year when there are more listings, Fairweather said. But they risk higher competition, she warned. \"You're trading one difficulty for another difficulty,\" Fairweather said. If mortgage rates further decline next year, the number of homes for sale might grow. Most homeowners are  sitting on loans  with record-low mortgage rates, creating a so-called \"lock-in effect,\" or \" golden handcuff \" effect, where they don't want to sell and finance a new home at a higher rate. \"We'll probably see more people who are buying, or selling to buy again,\" said Fairweather, because high borrowing costs held them back."

This as the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 6.13% from 6.15%, with points increasing to 0.57 from 0.56 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment.

While the jump compared with a year ago is large and the share is now a majority of total mortgage demand, the level of refinance activity is still modest compared with prior refi waves, according to Kan. Part of that is the seasonal slowdown in homebuying. Mortgage applications to purchase a home rose just 1% for the week and were 2% higher than the same week one year ago. Buyers are still facing high home prices and limited supply of houses for sale. \"Average loan sizes were higher both for purchase and refinance applications, which pushed the overall average loan size to its highest in the survey's history at $413,100,\" Kan added. Mortgage rates haven't moved much to start this week, and will likely wait for more pressing economic data later in the week and at the start of October."

        "content": "Join us on October 24th at 1pm for an online Your Money event:   REGISTER HERE Open enrollment season can be a whirlwind for anyone. Being in a relationship adds an extra layer of complexity, especially when your  workplace enrollment windows  don't align. Conflicting deadlines,  varying benefits options  and differing risk appetites make it challenging for couples to coordinate their choices. However, you can make sure your benefits decisions complement one another to create a full program that suits everyone's needs. You just need to time it,  talk it through , and know when to seek support. Here's how. The first key to navigating open enrollment together is communicating early. Don't wait until the last minute to discuss your benefits options. When people wait too long, they end up needing to rely on assumptions, because they can't get the information they need in time. If one of your enrollment deadlines approaches right when the other's enrollment window opens, reach out to the latter's enrollment team for those options in the second window as soon as possible. Sometimes, employers only make snapshots of plans readily accessible online, and you have to request complete copies of the plans to have all of the information. When you're making comparisons, you want to have as many details as possible. Here's a look at more stories from CNBC's  Financial Advisor Council : The good thing is, regardless of when enrollment windows open or close, you can have big-picture conversations as a couple to set the stage for informed decision-making. Ask each other the following questions: By getting on the same page early, you'll be better equipped to make thoughtful decisions around your benefits that reflect your shared priorities. Understanding what's available to each of you is critical to coordinating your benefits effectively. Many workplaces offer a wide array of options, from health insurance to retirement contributions, disability coverage and even wellness programs. Comparing these benefits side by side will allow you to determine which ones make the most sense for your household. Start by getting all the relevant documents for your and your partner's benefits offerings. This might include your benefits guide, summary plan descriptions and any other detailed documents your employers provide. Like we mentioned above, this may require you to proactively ask for more information sooner from one of your employers. Hopefully, they'll be able to provide you something or at least address your request first when the options are finalized. Then, create a benefits inventory by listing out the options available to both of you. Include details for: upfront costs (like deductibles), recurring costs (like payroll deductions for your health insurance premiums and retirement contributions), limits of coverage and benefits (not just dollar amounts but in- and out-of-network coverage) and how much your employers contribute to your health and retirement plans. Sometimes, the better option is obvious.But often, you're not making apples-to-apples comparisons, because employers and organizations have different objectives that reflect in their offerings. You need to assess them in the context of what works best for your family to find the right answer for you. After you have gathered all your benefits information, it's time to develop a strategy. Even if your enrollment windows are different, you should create a cohesive plan by considering both of your options together. It's worth mentioning that some benefits, like disability insurance, are just for the individual enrollee and might not require much thinking beyond whether one partner wants to participate or not. However, other benefits such as medical, vision, dental and life insurance may offer coverage for more than one person and should be considered together. Decide which benefits are most important to you and your partner. For many people, major medical insurance is typically the most important benefit because it offsets the risk of the highest health care costs and provides access to necessary medical care you may need throughout the year. Make sure you are aware of your employer subsidies in play. Some employers, for example, pay for some or all of the health insurance premiums for their employees. They may or may not extend that to spousal or family coverage, though. You want to take advantage of as many employer subsidies as you can, so depending on how they break out, you and your partner might want to enroll in separate plans. You should also consider how each of you view risk. In the context of insurance, it's hard to conclude which options work best for you without understanding how you feel about handling certain situations when they occur. For example, do you like having access to many medical specialists throughout the year, or do you barely go to the doctor and prefer a \"wait and see\" approach? Selecting more comprehensive health insurance offsets the financial risks of medical care, but there's an emotional component, too. Do you feel better knowing you have more coverage in the event of an emergency? That matters. Even if you lined up everything perfectly last year, it's critical to review your benefits every year. Lives change, jobs change, your finances change. At least twice a year, discuss benefits in  your regular money meetings  as a couple. Talk about whether they feel like enough or too much, whether they've  made cash feel tight , or any other concerns you may have about your current strategy. This way, you know whether you're going into your next enrollment season with changes to make and can be proactive instead of reactive to get what you need. If you're feeling overwhelmed by the process, don't hesitate to seek professional help. Financial advisors, benefits specialists, and even your human resources department can provide good insights into your options and help you make the best choices for your situation. Some advisors specialize in working with couples and can help you coordinate your benefits strategies in a way that aligns with your broader financial goals. Coordinating open enrollment decisions as a couple can be challenging, but it can also serve as an opportunity to strengthen your partnership. By communicating openly, understanding each other's options, and creating a shared strategy, you can make sure that your benefits work in harmony regardless of when your enrollment windows open and close.

        "content": "Join us on October 24th at 1pm for an online Your Money event:   REGISTER HERE Handling the  estate  of a deceased parent can be an emotional process for children already dealing with grief. Those emotions can  become more complicated  if the estate plan doesn't unfold as expected  say, if there is an uneven split of assets among children or a previously unknown heir who comes forward to claim a share of the estate. Feelings of pain and betrayal can be avoided by having discussions about your estate plan with your family before death; however, estate planning attorneys say these conversations are rare. About two-thirds of Americans, 68%, say discussing end-of-life preparations with loved ones is important, but only 47%  have done so , according to a 2022 Ethos survey of 1,000 adults. A 2024 report from online estate planning service  Trust & Will  found that 34% of millennials are unsure if their parents even have an estate plan.The site polled 1,000 adults. Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. If a client refuses to disclose information about their estate to their heirs, it can put an estate planner or financial advisor in the difficult position of doing so after that client's death. \"I think a lot of lawyers are hesitant to point out the ramifications of some of these things,\" said New Jersey-based estate planning attorney Martin Shenkman. One estate surprise may be assets given to a person, pet or entity, such as a charity or alma mater, the family wasn't expecting as a beneficiary, experts say. It's also possible that a previously unknown heir steps forward, such as a half sibling the deceased's children weren't aware of. It's unclear how common unexpected heirs are, but estate planning bombshells aren't unusual. More than a third, 36%, of people with a will  say there are surprises  for their beneficiaries in that document, according to a 2023 LegalShield survey. The site polled 1,316 adults. About 3% of wills in the U.S. are contested, according to a 2013 study published in the  Nevada Law Journal . In the case of a previously unknown heir coming forward, experts say the first consideration is the will. If the will is vague or unclear  say, if it designates an asset to be split \"among my children\" rather than naming individuals  there could be disputes that could require court intervention, according to Mitch Mitchell, Trust & Will's probate expert. Probate  laws vary by state, he said, but it's rare for genetic testing to be required to prove that a previously unknown heir is related. Typically, half siblings don't have to prove who they are more than any other child of the deceased. \"As for inheritance divided equally, while states may vary regarding how much of a share a half sibling is to receive, this variation generally only exists when a half sibling is inheriting through a sibling, not a common parent,\" Mitchell said. \"Generally, for inheritance through a common parent, half siblings receive the same inheritance in equal parts with all other siblings.\" When there is no will, a state's  intestacy laws  will determine how the property is divided, experts say, typically favoring the closest relatives. The  inheritance process  can be a messy one if someone is written out of the will or an  inheritance  is divided unequally  especially if the decedent doesn't detail why they made such choices. \"There have been a zillion times when people have told me, 'No, all the kids get along. They all understand what I've done,'\" Shenkman said. \"And they may believe that because the kids appear to get along. But as soon as the parents are gone, those emotions come out of the closet like a torrent, and no, they don't always get along.\" Shenkman said attorneys should have open and honest discussions with clients and ask questions about motivations during the will-writing process. \"When I've seen parents or family members  disinherit  somebody, it's really a kick in the gut in most cases,\" he said. Shenkman also encourages clients to have discussions with their children that are age appropriate, even if they don't disclose dollar amounts. This can help explain the decision-making behind how an inheritance is split up and avoid any feelings of betrayal after a parent's passing, he said. Other things that can complicate the estate planning process are non-traditional family situations such as same-sex couples,  gender transitions , assisted reproduction or  surrogacies . Anything that can create ambiguity in how wills or trusts are interpreted requires creative solutions, experts say. Shenkman recommends involving an objective third party, such as a trust protector or friend, in the estate planning process to provide impartial perspectives for when it's time to read the will. Many people avoid writing a will or creating a trust at all due to procrastination or superstition surrounding death, experts say. But reframing the estate planning process as leaving a positive legacy, rather than just distributing assets after death, can help clients take on a more compassionate  long-term view . \"The first step to avoiding these kinds of hardships is do everything from a compassionate perspective, not from anger,\" Shenkman said. \"Don't write a will from anger. Don't write an estate plan from anger.\""

        "header": "Up to $400 to change a lightbulb? Appliance repair costs are no joke",
        "content": "Join us on October 24th at 1pm for an online Your Money event:   REGISTER HERE I bought a General Electric microwave oven in 2020 for $355. Recently, I noticed the interior light was out. I told my husband, since hes the one who takes care of  repairs  in our house. He took a look, only to learn that this wasnt going to be an easy fix. The lightbulb is built into the unit so that it requires taking the  microwave  apart to change, and a technician is recommended. It sounds like the setup to a lightbulb joke: How much does it cost to change a microwave bulb? The answer, however, wasnt funny. When my husband and I started gathering estimates, we learned that the labor costs involved could be up to $400, maybe more  and that didnt include the cost of the lightbulb. Heres a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. While my lightbulb situation may be somewhat unique, experts say it is not uncommon to learn the cost of repairs is more than the cost to replace an appliance. Gay Gordon-Byrne had a similar experience with a microwave she purchased to match a stove.The microwave touchpad stopped working. She figured out how to do the repair herself, but said the manufacturer tried to charge her $600 for the replacement part.   Instead, she bought a new microwave for $175. I tell the story all the time because its so emblematic of whats wrong with appliances these days, said Gordon-Byrne, who is the executive director of Repair.org, which advocates for the legal right of owners to repair their own devices. My first call to repair our microwave was to the appliance store where I made the purchase. The service center told me there would be $140 charge to come out, and they couldnt guarantee that the technician would have a lightbulb on the truck. The service representative suggested I simply purchase a new microwave or shop around for other repair options. Next, I went to the GE site and filled out a form for service. I learned that the charge for a technician to come would be $125. When the technician called, I explained the situation and that I needed to know how much it would cost before he came out. He told me he would charge for labor and parts. How much? Since the microwave sits in a cabinet above the counter, to remove it would be a two man job, he said, and could cost upwards of $400 for the labor. What if my husband and I took the microwave out and placed it on the counter?In that case the labor charge would be closer to $200, but that wasnt an exact estimate. It also didnt include the cost of the lightbulb. I canceled the visit and the technician said there would be no charge. When I asked GE Appliances why the microwave was designed this way, a spokesperson responded via e-mail that microwave lights are designed to last the lifetime of the product and failures are very uncommon in their products. The light fixture is more than a standard bulb that has to be encased behind a metal enclosure. Its not a simple screw-in and requires electrical training and background, the spokesperson said. Given the high voltage nature of microwaves, it not safe for consumers without a deep electrical understanding to operate on the interior of a microwave.She also noted that service techs are required to test for emissions to comply with strict standards set by the U.S. government. State lawmakers and consumer advocates have been trying to make it easier and cheaper for consumers to get their devices repaired. Several states  including California, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York  have implemented so-called right to repair laws. Typically, the laws require manufacturers of certain devices  such as consumer electronics or appliances  to make parts, physical and software tools and repair information, like schematics, available at a fair and reasonable price. These laws can make it more straightforward for consumers to do repairs themselves, and widen professional repair options, too. Colorado and Oregon have passed right to repair legislation that will go into effect in the next year, and  more than a dozen others have introduced bills, according to Repair.org. We are just now starting to see the impact of legislation that weve been working on for 10 years, said Gordon-Byrne. The earliest right to repair bills were filed in 2014, she said  including the first, in South Dakota, which failed  and we really only got the first three laws in place to start July first of this year. There are limits to what these laws can do. Typically they only cover purchases made in recent years, and can be product-specific. New Yorks law, for example, doesnt include appliances. Some states have separate laws to cover specific products like autos, farm equipment and electronic wheelchairs. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission said in a 2021  report to Congress  that restricting consumers and businesses from choosing how they repair products can substantially increase the total cost of repairs, generate harmful electronic waste, and unnecessarily increase wait times for repairs. The Commission has also brought warranty-related enforcement actions and this summer  sent warning letters  to several manufacturers about their warranty practices. Critics of right to repair legislation say the patchwork of state laws are too broad and may do more harm than good. These state proposals and state laws could lead to a lose-lose situation in which manufacturers are harmed because it undercuts their profits, and consumers are harmed because they either see a decreased kind of quality of these products or an increase in price, said Alex Reinauer, a research fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Consumer advocates say state laws and the FTC actions help, but havent solved the problem. One of the main reasons why its so difficult to fix things is because theyre designed with kind of a hostility to repair, or an ambivalence to repair, said Nathan Proctor, the senior director of U.S. PIRGs Right to Repair campaign. To give consumers more information, US PIRG is also launching a new effort to bring repair-score labeling to the U.S. Right now, theres no way to tell what products are designed to be serviceable, and therefore last, and be resilient and durable, Proctor said. France already has this kind of system, he said, and the EU is rolling out a repairability index, with a rating system that scores a product based on factors including a repair-friendly design and the price and availability of parts. Scores range from zero to 10, with higher numbers indicating a more repairable product and greater longevity expectations. However, those scores are subjective and may not hold up over time. For example, if a manufacturer discontinues making a part, that reparability score may not longer be accurate. Competitive Enterprise Institutes Reinauer is keeping a score of his own, using a spreadsheet that compares the Ingress Protection (IP) rating, which grades how a product stands up to water and dust intrusion, with the reparability index. He says that comparison doesnt favor repairs. When a when a product is more repairable, typically its less durable, said Reinauer, so there are trade-offs in this. Depending on the nature of the problem and safety issues involved, a repair may be worth trying to tackle on your own. Appliance owners may find help from others online. Researching the broken items issue on the web often leads to information and guides posted by others who have encountered the same issue, or a similar issue and how they addressed it, said Peter Mui, the founder of Fixit Clinics. Product owners can get help with a do-it-yourself project at a  Fixit Clinic  or online at Discord. Im weighing whether its worth trying to fix our microwave ourselves or to just live without an interior light. We could try to make it a fun community DIY event, but we risk a repair failure. The microwave model we have now typically costs between $420 and $480 new, if we want to replace it  but I promise I will not buy another appliance without checking ifI can change the lightbulb. Feels like theres a bad joke in here somewhere."

Americans feelings about which candidate may win are also  driving peoples decisions  about their own finances. Nearly two-thirds of Americans, 63%, are deferring financial decisions about vacations, car and home purchases, and remodeling projects until after the November election, according to a  CFP Board survey  of 1,005 Americans conducted in early August. But waiting for election results may not be the best move. Experts advise evaluating if a financial decision should be made sooner, and considering the cost of waiting. Remember, major policy changes requiring legislation  take time , with the president and members of Congress in agreement. Financial advisors say the election or its results  shouldnt be the driving factor  for money decisions. Instead, they say people should focus on their own goals. Ask yourself: If Candidate A won or Candidate B won, would they really do something different? said Michael Liersch, head of advice and planning at Wells Fargo. Its more important to consider your personal financial plan and how a big purchase relates to it. Often, the political outcome generates uncertainty over a purchase or investment decision, but it probably wont change the outcome of whether its a smart move. Heres a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. When Im talking with a client who thinks theyre going to put something off, we go back to that plan, said certified financial planner Liz Miller, founder and president of Summit Place Financial Advisors, Summit, New Jersey. Often, she said, they find that theres no need to delay. Consider a best-case scenario, worst-case scenario and something in between. Within that framework, you can test it, said Liersch. Dont wait for the outcome to be known. Look into it now, map out those possibilities, and see if it would even change your decision in any way, shape, or form. Take, for example, concerns about Social Security benefits  being reduced , which 81% of respondents said was a top concern in an  Edelman Financial Engines  survey. Absent action from Congress, the trust fund Social Security relies on to pay retirement benefits is   due to run out  in 2033. At that time, just 79% of benefits will be payable. There are steps you can take to give you some perspective, including  getting your Social Security benefit estimate  and looking at where you can boost savings. Figure what a benefit cut might mean for you: Can you budget differently in coming years to help make up for that shortfall? Paying down debt, building an emergency fund, and sticking with your investment strategy are solid moves right now, experts say. As you see all of these different things, these headlines, in a very uncertain world, you can feel more at peace that number one, you are doing the right things, and that youre on solid financial footing, said CFP  Stacy Francis , president and CEO of Francis Financial in New York City. She is also a member of the  CNBC Financial Advisor Council . Francis is spending time with clients now updating their financial plans and mapping it out to age 95. Many are  considering Roth conversions  ahead of tax policy changes, for example. Candidate pitches around  capital gain taxes  are also concerning investors. Experts say, regardless of election results, with double-digit gains in the stock market, now is a good time to evaluate whether to take some gains. We are proactively talking about what is the ability to take some capital gains this year, when we know the capital gain tax rates are stable and we know what to expect, said Miller, who is 2024 Chair-Elect of the the CFP Board. While waiting to take action until after the election results are known, consider if its necessary. Ask yourself, is delaying this decision just to see the outcome of the election, Is that really worth the distance in delaying that decision or would making the decision sooner provide a greater benefit, said Wells Fargos Liersch."

        "content": "Chinese property stocks rallied on Tuesday after top financial regulators vowed a range of monetary easing measures to provide some relief for millions of families and boost a recovery in the real estate market. During a high-level press conference Tuesday morning, Peoples Bank of China Gov. Pan Gongsheng announced that Beijing would reduce the interest rates on existing individual mortgages by an average of 0.5 percentage points, and the lower down-payment ratio for second homes purchases to 15% from 25%. Its the first time that down payment levels for first and second homes are unified, and the lower rate is expected by the PBOC to reduce household interest payments on mortgages by an average of 150 billion yuan a year ($21.25 billion). Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index surged as much as 5% when Hong Kong markets opened shortly after the announcement was made. Hong Kong-listed shares of real estate developers like  China Resources Land ,  Longfor Group Holdings  and  China Overseas Land & Investment  were some of the biggest movers on the Hang Seng index, gaining as much as 4.49%, 4.57% and 5.41%, respectively. Chinese policymakers have been ramping up support to reduce households financial burden and shore up the troubled real estate sector. Previous measures have done little to spur a meaningful recovery, with  property-related investment falling  more than 10% in the first eight months this year, from a year ago. The central bank will also offer guidance for commercial banks to improve pricing mechanisms for mortgage loans, Pan said at the briefing, where he also announced that that China will cut the amount of cash banks need to have in hand, known  as the reserve requirement ratio or RRR , by 50 basis points. The impacts from the new measures are likely to be limited as rate cuts on existing loans would not spur demands for new homes, and might slow down PBOCs pace of further lowering the loan prime rates, William Wu, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, said in an email, according to CNBCs translation of the Chinese. Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL, an investment management firm, predicted that the housing market will still take time to bottom out. It is necessary and urgent to launch supportive measures on all fronts and ASAP, Pang said, but authorities will also need to provide effective and efficient support to developers to boost property investment and construction activities. Bloomberg  reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter, that China was mulling a plan to allow homeowners to renegotiate terms with their current lenders before January next year. Homeowners could also be allowed to refinance with a different bank for the first time in years, the outlet reported."

        "content": "Join us on October 24th at 1pm for an online Your Money event:   REGISTER HERE Getting a credit card can be a smart financial move for college students, offering a range of benefits and opportunities to build a solid credit history early on. According to student loan provider Sallie Mae, about 57% of students have a credit card. Student credit cards facilitate financial approvals, can help build good credit, and impart valuable financial lessons. But credit cards also carry risks such as potential long-term debt and high interest rates, making it crucial for college students to manage their spending responsibly. Rules have changed in recent decades to provide more protections for students. In the 1980s, credit card soliciting on college campuses was not uncommon. In fact, universities often partnered with credit card companies to offer credit cards that featured the college's mascot on the card. That changed after the financial crisis, with the 2009 Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act, which offered protections to consumers to avoid getting into credit card debt. Credit card companies now must stay at least 1,000 feet away from college campuses when offering gifts to students in exchange for completing credit card applications. It is also much harder for college-aged students to get a credit card on their own  anyone under 21 must have an adult cosigner or show that they can repay their credit card balance through their income for a standard credit card. Newer regulations have made it more difficult for college students to get credit cards, but also protect them from misusing cards and developing bad debt habits at a young age. Now, many students have credit cards connected to their parent's bank accounts with set amounts they can spend each month. Student credit cards, specifically, are a good option for financial beginners, and experts say it is important for students to have the opportunity to build credit and maintain a positive credit history so after graduation they can secure attractive rates on personal loans, auto loans, mortgages, and be approved for an apartment lease. Emily Rabbideau, a senior at the University of Alabama, has had her student credit card for seven months and she already feels like she is in a better position with her financial future. With her college graduation not far away, Rabbideau knew she wanted to put herself in the best possible position for post-grad financial decisions, such as buying a car or applying for an apartment lease. When she received a flyer about a Discover student credit card in the mail, she immediately completed an application for it. \"I wanted to start building a credit score, and I figured I was spending all this money anyway so I might as well get some points and some cashback rewards on it,\" she said. Previously denied for a non-student credit card, she was accepted for  a Discover it Student Cash Back Card  after completing a 5-minute application. Seven months later, navigating her finances with a student credit card has been smooth sailing.  Her main tip for anyone considering getting a student credit card is to make sure you never put yourself in the position of spending more than you can pay back in full when the next statement arrives. That means treating a credit card like a debit card  any money being put on the card needs to already be in the bank. Never carrying a balance allows Rabbideau to stay stress-free when it comes to paying off the card. \"I pay my credit card back right away and never carry a balance ever,\" she said. \"Just because your credit card says you could spend $1,500 a month, let's say, that doesn't mean you have $1,500 in your bank account to spend. If you don't pay it back right away, then you're going to have to pay more than that and get a hit to your credit score.\" Dr. Preston Cherry, a member of the  CNBC Financial Advisor Council , says paying back a credit card immediately is critical. \"You want to try to avoid carrying a balance because it's going to charge you interest, and interest is going to be a lot when you are new with your credit history or your relationship with credit,\" said Cherry. Any balance not paid off at the end of a statement period will be charged interest the following month, and if a student continues to struggle to pay off the balance, the interest will compound. Interest rates for student credit cards also tend to be higher than for a typical credit card given the lack of financial experience. The interest rate for a student credit card can also be very high because students have no previous credit history, as high as 29% in some cases, Cherry said. According to LendingTree, the average interest rate on a student credit card was near 24% in September, and the maximum interest rate was near 29%. \"It's okay to enjoy life, but you can't buy things that you can't afford, because if you can't pay them back, then that compounding interest starts to become a big issue,\" Cherry said. \"The stress of debt affects your future financial decisions, your lifestyle flexibility, and it affects your emotional wellbeing.\" There are also many benefits of disciplined credit card use by students, including points and rewards. Once Rabbideau received her student credit card, she started to use it on all her purchases  rather than use her debit card  because of a 5% cash back feature as part of the card rewards. She takes the money she gets back from purchases and puts it into a savings account. Meanwhile, use of the card was leading her credit score to improve. \"The first six months it was just tracking all of my purchases, and then I got my credit score in June, and was excited to see it go up over the months,\" she said. Getting a better credit score can also come with new risks to manage  she saw an increase to her credit limit at the same time. Cherry encourages students to apply for student credit cards as early as they can to have years of good credit history under their belt. \"A good credit score will give you more access to borrowing, and a decrease in borrowing costs, whether that is a car loan, house loan, or some other type of loan,\" he said. \"If you don't have a credit history to begin with, these costs are all going to be higher.\" When you're out of college, a good credit score will also help you apply for new credit cards with better rewards. Students do not have to stop using a student credit card once they graduate. If an account is in good standing, it can be changed over to a regular credit card, often with a higher credit limit. Credit card apps have made it easier to manage payments, and never miss due dates. Accounts can be set up with automatic payments covering the full statement balance so there is never the risk of forgetting. There is, however, the risk that if not spending wisely, the student's bank account being used to make the autopayment won't cover the balance. If a student can't make a full payment in time, Cherry says it won't help to give yourself a hard time, but it is is time to take action to limit the damage to your credit history, and make sure you never make the same mistake again. \"No. 1: Don't get too down or have too much shame or guilt about it. No. 2: Do better immediately next month. Only time doing the better behavior and habit will improve your score,\" he said. Even just one missed month of payment means three to six months of good behavior is needed to attempt to have the late payment reversed on your credit report. If you continue to miss payments, it's going to take longer to repair credit. \"If you correct the error immediately, you shorten the time frame of credit repair,\" he said. A college student interested in applying for a student credit card on their own typically needs to be at least 18 years-old, enrolled in college, and may be asked to state an income level, or show proof of income  such as from a part-time job, work/study program, grants or scholarships, or an allowance from family  as part of the application process. Another way to build credit history is to opt for  a secured credit card . Similar to a student credit card, a secured credit card is a good option for applicants without a credit history or proof of income. A secured credit card can also help you build your credit score, as well as benefit from card rewards. With a secured credit card, the applicant typically must pay a cash deposit and is help to a relatively low credit limit. Having a credit card can be a strategic financial decision for college students. With responsible repayment habits, a student credit card can be a powerful tool for securing a better financial future. While there are always opportunities to build credit after college, having access to a student credit card and using it wisely is a great tool that can place you at a financial advantage once you graduate.

        "content": "Join us on October 24th at 1pm for an online Your Money event:   REGISTER HERE Brandon Copeland is a former NFL linebacker turned coach. But the type of coaching he gravitates to isn't in the realm of sports  it's in personal finance. The 33-year-old  who  played for six teams  across 10 seasons in the National Football League before retiring last year  started  co-teaching a financial literacy course  to undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, his alma mater, in 2019 while playing for the New York Jets. The course, nicknamed \"Life 101,\" was inspired by his own experiences with money, according to \"Professor Cope,\" who is also a member of the  CNBC Global Financial Wellness Advisory Board  and co-founder of Athletes.org, the players' association for college athletes. Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. Now, the Orlando resident has written a new book, \" Your Money Playbook ,\" that reads as a football coach's blueprint to winning the financial \"game.\" It touches on topics like budgeting, paying down debt, saving, estate planning and starting a side hustle. (Just don't call it a \"side hustle,\" as he explains in the book.) CNBC reached Copeland by phone to discuss his journey into financial education, why becoming a millionaire \"is not a sexy thing\" and how it helps to think in terms of Chipotle burritos. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Greg Iacurci: What got you interested in teaching personal finance and financial literacy? Brandon Copeland:  Feeling unprepared for some of the major financial decisions in life. We go to school for all these years and we [learn] about the tangent of a 45-degree angle, but we don't talk about appliances and how to buy them, or how to make sure you protect yourself when you're renting your first apartment and what  renters insurance  is. I always thought it was crazy that I had to make it to the Baltimore Ravens to learn what a 401(k) was. That was 2013, my rookie year. I learned what a 401(k) was when the NFL Players Association came and told us about the benefits you get for contributing. Fast forward to December 2016: My wife and I, we bought our first house, in New Jersey. When we bought that house I was in Detroit playing for the Lions. My wife was at the closing table and she called me and [asked], \"Hey, does everything look right on this?\" They e-mailed me the closing documents; it was 100 pages and I had no idea what I was looking at. I could see the purchase price was the price that we agreed to, but then I saw all these other titles and warranty deeds and this and that. And I'm like, \"I have no idea if I'm getting screwed right now.\" One of my biggest fears being an NFL player has always been, somebody's taking advantage of me. GI: What do you think is the most important takeaway from your book? BC:  The power of growth. That was the big discovery for me as I started to make money. I had no idea that existed as a kid. I always tell people, you either put the money to work for you or you go to work the rest of your life for money. There's a lot of folks who are afraid of the [stock] market. And I'm like, well, everyone's an investor. If you have a dollar to your name, you're an investor. If you take your money, you put it under your mattress, you do nothing with it, you put it in a safe in the house: That's an investment decision. That's a 0% return. If you take your money, you put it in a regular checking account, that's a 0.01% return. You put it into a  high-yield savings account , it's a 4% to 5% return. The stock market, you put it in an index fund, the  S&P 500 , that may be an  average 9% to 10% return . All of those are investment decisions, you just have to choose wisely. [People] can put their money to work for them and get out of the \"rat race\" at some point. GI: For someone who is just starting out  let's say they have been hesitant to invest their money in the market  how would you suggest they get started? BC:  I think the first thing you've got to do is download the [financial news] apps  the CNBCs of the world, the MarketWatch, Yahoo Finance, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg  and turn on the notifications. Those notifications are starting to explain to you what is moving the market and why, and you're starting to learn the language of money. Whether you choose to invest money or not, you're at least starting to get comfortable with, \"Oh, the market's down today. Well, why?\" I think that's important to start to develop your stomach. The other thing is, start to look at where [your] money is: What account your money is sitting in and how much is in those accounts. By doing that, you're starting to look at your money from a 30,000-foot view. You can start to determine, \"I have X amount of dollars over here in my traditional checking account. Maybe I can take some of that money and put it over into a high-yield savings account that is now giving me 4% interest on it annually. And by getting 4% interest on it annually, maybe that's generating me $500 a year that I otherwise wouldn't have had.\" Now you're starting to put yourself in the game of money. What is the limited amount of effort I can do and still be generating money on my behalf? As a kid, if somebody said, \"Hey, man, I'll give you $500 to do nothing, to press two buttons,\" you'd be like, \"Sign me up!\" I always break that down as, that's a lot of Chipotle burritos, that's a lot of dinners, that's a lot of time with my family at the water park. By doing that, it makes it more of a priority for me to hurry up and make that investment decision. GI: One of the first things that you encourage people to do in the book is say aloud to themselves, \"I can be wealthy.\" Why? BC:  In football, your money or your job can be taken away from you overnight or through an injury. A lot of times, as I was making money, I was always just kind of looking around the corner. Even to this day, I still think about it as if somebody can rip the rug out from under my feet. So I'm still sometimes in survival mode. I think that although you can be making money, there are still ways where you can have anxiety around money, your lifestyle and when you spend money  all those things. Starting to have positive affirmations  \"I deserve to be rich. I deserve to have money. I deserve to not be stressed about keeping the lights on. I can be wealthy. I can do this\"  sometimes you've got to coach yourself on that. Because where else do you go get that positive affirmation that you can do it? Doing those things over time not only reinforce positive connotations about yourself, but they also genuinely have a real effect on your mental wellness. It is really, really hard to walk out of the house and be a super productive human being in society when you don't know if the doors will be locked or changed the next time you get there.  GI: You write in the book that the journey of financial empowerment will require people to confront their \"inner money myths. \"  What's the most common myth around money that you hear? BC:  For lot of communities that I serve it's, put your money in the bank. GI: You mean keeping it in cash and not investing it? BC:  Exactly. I think it's a myth because you put your money in the bank, and the bank goes out and invests your money: They invest it in other people's projects, other people's homes, and then get a rate of return on your money. Not to say banks are bad and saving is bad, [but] you've got to figure out at some point when can I get to the point where I can put my money to work for me? I think that some of the myths are about whether wealth is for you or not. A lot of millionaires, it's not a sexy thing. A lot of times you feel like you've got to go and create the next Instagram or Snapchat or TikTok in order to ever be wealthy, when really you've just got to make simple, consistent, disciplined decisions. That is the toughest thing in the world, to have delayed gratification or to subject yourself to delayed gratification. I think a lot of times, we don't prepare for the situation we will be in one day or could be in one day. GI: How do you balance today versus tomorrow? BC:  I went to a school a couple weeks ago and [asked] the athletes there write out what they want their life to look like five years after graduation. By doing that and saying, \"Hey, I want this with my life. I want it to look like this, and I want vacations to be like this,\" now you can always look at what you're actually doing and determine whether your current actions [are working toward] your future, the future things that you want for yourself. I think a lot of us never spend the time write out what we actually want or to visualize what we actually want with life. And so you end up going to school, you go to college, and you're there just to get a good job and make money, but you don't really map out what that job is and what you like to do versus what you don't like to do. You end up being just a pinball in life. I literally put people in my life to help hold me accountable. The best way I'd say to balance between delayed gratification and enjoying where you are today is having those accountability buddies who can tell you straight up, \"Hey, you're slacking,\" or \"Hey, you're doing a good job.\" But you can also map out against your own goals and wants for yourself, and [ask], are my actions actually adding up to this? GI: You write in the book that carrying high-interest debt, like credit card debt, and simultaneously investing is like putting the heat on high during the winter in Green Bay, Wisconsin, while also keeping the windows wide open. Can you explain? BC:  Sometimes folks are putting money in the market to try to get 6%, 9%, 10%, 12%, whatever, when they may be making the minimum payment on their credit card or no payment at all, which would be even worse, and they're paying 18% [as an interest rate]. You are automatically locking in a losing scenario for yourself that you're not going to be able to outpace.

        "header": "Your favorite stocks may soon be quoted in half-penny increments, which could cut trading costs",
        "content": "Investors may soon see their favorite stocks quoted in half-penny increments. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will vote Wednesday to change the minimum pricing increment for many large-cap stocks, likely to allow for pricing increments of a half-cent. The agency rolled out this proposed rule in late 2022. The measure would likely affect the pricing of most of the largest stocks, including most in the S&P 500 .It may also affect the pricing of some highly liquid exchange-traded funds. Currently, the minimum pricing increment  or tick size  for most stocks is one cent. Before the mid-1990s, the stock brokerage business was very profitable. Since the 1800s, the smallest increment that a stock traded at was an eighth of a dollar, or 12.5 cents. A broker might have a bid  a price at which they would be willing to buy  of $20.00 for XYZ stock, and an ask  that is, a price at which they would be willing to sell  of $20.125. That's an eighth of a dollar higher. That turned out to be a very lucrative business. This all began to change in the 1990s.In 1997, the minimum tick size went from an eighth of a dollar to a sixteenth, or 6.25 cents. This dropped to a penny in 2001. These reductions in tick size had a profound effect on the brokerage business.It made stock trading far less profitable, but it provided big savings to buyers and sellers of stocks.Reducing the tick size also improved market liquidity. As the volume of trading in the largest stocks has expanded, the trading community has debated about whether tick sizes should be reduced further. For starters, certain highly liquid stocks are \"tick constrained,\" meaning they could easily trade if the tick size were reduced further. There have been discussions about adding tick sizes of a tenth of a cent or a fifth of a cent, as well as a half cent. Why reduce the tick size further?For the same reason minimum pricing increments were reduced decades earlier:This would reduce trading costs. Most in the trading industry feel the SEC will settle on a half-cent increment because trading in increments of one-tenth of a penny creates too many price points. Investors who dread the idea of their favorite stocks being quoted in half-penny increments will likely have some time to get used to it. Most market participants told me any change would likely take a year or more to implement, as it would require changes in the systems that display quotations."

        "content": "Today is triple witching expiration , the quarterly expiration of single stock and index options, and index futures.Each of the four days is traditionally one of the most actively traded sessions of the year. It's occurring at an unusual moment:The S & P 500 is at a historic high.That, Chris Murphy at Susquehanna says, makes bulls happy and bears unhappy. \"Given we have rallied back to all-time highs 1) most puts are deep out of the money and 2) calls are in the money  I think the main way expiration would have an impact would be if we start selling off and market makers who are long hedged calls  need to start selling.\" Week after triple witch:poor Unfortunately, the week after the September triple witch is historically among the weakest of the year. \"The week after September quarterly options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 34 years,\" Jeff Hirsch from the Stock Trader's Almanac told clients last week, noting that the week after has been down 27 of the past 34 years. Fourth week of September:poor (avg. losses since 1990) Dow Industrials - 1.09% S & P 500 - 1.06% Nasdaq - 1.06% Source:Stock Trader's Almanac \"End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter,\" Hirsch said. S & P 500 rebalancing today The S & P 500 will see three new entrants at the close today, each of which will begin trading as part of the S & P on Monday: Dell Technologies , Erie Indemnity and Palantir Technologies . They will replace Etsy , Bio Rad Laboratories and American Airlines Group . As is typical, the \" S & P inclusion effect \" is very evident.This is the phenomenon where the inclusion of a stock in the S & P 500 from the day the inclusion is announced to the day it actually goes in the index usually results in a move up that outperforms the market.This is attributed to demand created by index funds that track the S & P 500. Since the announcement at the close on Sept. 6, Dell is up 17% and Palantir is ahead 20%. Finally, while the S & P 500 is at a new high, the Russell 2000 small-cap index is not far behind.It is only 2% from a 52-week high (the historic high was 2021), and a breakout here would get the bulls even more excited because it adds to the \"broadening out\" story."

        "header": "Future Proof gathering in California surf town is trying to reinvent the investment conference",
        "content": "HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.  This idyllic beach town about an hour south of Los Angeles is what everyone from Iowa thinks California looks like: crashing waves, endless miles of white sand beaches, stunning vistas, and plenty of tan and healthy-looking people. Huntington Beach in particular likes to think of itself as the beach volleyball capital of the world. For the next four days, it will also be host to one of the largest financial conferences in the world. More than 4,000 people have descended here for the Future Proof conference , a vast social gathering designed to give younger registered investment advisors and other investment professionals access to what they want. What they want, apparently, is an intense desire to network with other RIAs and investment professionals and find ways to grow their business. They also seem very particular about the kind of content they want to hear: anything about AI and how to use it, alternative investments, a bit of crypto, and a bit on the markets and the economy. Alongside serious discussions and networking they are also very comfortable with parallel classes on wine consumption, craft beer instructions, yoga, nature walks, and even rock bands (Third Eye Blind!) playing in the evening. Around this mass of RIAs is a small army of sell-side professionals eager to sell them ETFs, mutual funds, financial and management advice, and anything else they need to grow their business. Many of these sell-side pros can be seen in panels that are sprinkled throughout the conference. Reimagining the financial conference Future Proof is the brainchild of Barry Ritholtz, co-founder, chairman, and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, and CEO Josh Brown. This is the third year for the conference, but Ritholtz and company have been doing conferences for 15 years. Ritholtz describes it as an ongoing project to reinvent the financial conference concept, which he says is \"moribund.\" \"We wanted something where people got out of the conference room, get out of the hotel and enjoyed the beach, enjoy the outdoors. Just because we're in finance doesn't mean we have to be staid and boring and running in the bowels of a giant conference, right?\" he said. The ETF and financial services industry is here in force, with representatives from JPMorgan Chase, Capital Group, State Street Global Advisors, Dimensional Funds, Van Eck and dozens of others trying hard to connect with younger independent investment professionals who don't go to traditional conferences. Much of this is being accomplished through a \"speed dating\" service that matches RIAs with sell-side providers for short, 15-minute one-on-ones. Fellow conference organizer Matt Middleton tells me that last year 16,000 meetings were arranged; this year he expects to double that, to 32,000. It's about networking When I asked a group of attendees at the opening panels Sunday afternoon what they were at the conference for, one answer came up most often: to meet with other RIAs and investment professionals. \"I'm here to network,\" Adarsh Shyamsundar from Polaris Capital Management told me. He became an RIA in 2022 after years in the tech business. \"This is about hearing what other advisors are saying, especially the small mom and pop shops around the country,\" Brett Rodgriguez from Graystone Consulting told me. \"We're hear to get something we can't get on a Zoom call--real one-on-one interaction with other people in our business.\" Delon Mansour, an RIA from San Diego, said it's about having a message for his clients. \"I want my clients to see that I am staying active and learning new strategies for their portfolios,\" he told me. Mansour also reflected another motivation for coming: He said he was on a hunt for more products he can use to better manage his business. Hot topics: AI, Alternative Investments, crypto, markets There's plenty of content here, and when asked what they most wanted to hear about, AI came in at top of the list. \"I want to know how people here are using AI,\" Shyamsundar said. \"How should I be using it, and how can I help my clients use AI better?\" \"If I'm using AI, how do I use it, how do I harness it?,\" Harris Nydick at CFS Investment Advisory told me. \"I want to use it effectively, I want to use it compliantly, and I want to know how to safely store the data.\" For Graystone Consulting's Brett Rodgriguez, it's about alternative investments. \"There is a lot of interest from my clients on investing in private equity,\" he told me. He'll hear plenty on that topic. There's a panel on private equity led by Akash Shah (BNY), Shannon Saccocia (NB Private Wealth), Raj Dhanda (Ares Management), and John Christmas (HPS Investment Partners). Also high on the list is crypto. Many RIAs said they were unsure on how to advise their clients. They'll get some advice from a panel with Mike Novogratz (Galaxy Digital) and Anna Paglia (State Street Global Advisors) on the state of crypto. Also often mentioned was the state of the markets . A trio of chief investment officers will offer their view on the direction of the markets for the remainder of the year, including Bryan Whalen (TCW), Saira Malik (Nuveen), and Lauren Goodwin (New York Life Investments). Ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, my colleague Scott Wapner will be interviewing DoubleLine Capital's Jeff Gundlach on the main stage and will later interview him for CNBC's \" Halftime Report .\" ETF luminaries like Jan van Eck and Matt Hougan (Bitwise Asset Management) will discuss the current state of ETFs, including coming competition from tokenization. Then there's the entertainment There are several dozen social events, many of which are invitation only, topped off with DJ Mick and the rock band Third Eye Blind on Tuesday night, sometime in the wee hours. There's also plenty of amusing asides for the attendees. Panels on cybersecurity and estate planning are interspersed with classes on craft beer making and \"Fish Taco Frenzy: Coastal Cooking Class.\" If that sounds a bit odd, it's not to any of the attendees. \"It's all about team-building,\" one RIA from Michigan told me at one of the social events at last year's Future Proof. He had brought all seven members of his team, and was making the rounds talking to other RIAs about, what else? How to grow their businesses. Much of the actual work was being done at the social events and the \"speed dating\" events where RIAs were seeking help on how to run their businesses. Put it all together, and there's enough content and social events to take up about 15 hours of the day for the next few days. I tell you, it's exhausting, being part of the financial intelligentsia. Bob Pisani be doing ETF Edge on Monday from the conference, talking to conference organizer Barry Ritholtz and Jon Maier, chief ETF strategist for JP Morgan, on \"Halftime Report\" on Monday at 12:35 p.m. ET. ETF Edge will livestream at 1 p.m. ET, when Pisani be talking to Jan Van Eck, Marlena Lee from Dimensional Fund Advisors and Jon Maier. That's on ETFEdge.cnbc.com ."

In other words, a tough, choppy market for investors. The markets opened positive, with a nice lift from Oracle , which is keeping the expanding artificial intelligence story going. The company's positive comments on AI helped lift the hyperscalers  Amazon , Microsoft and Alphabet  as well. Nvidia rose as much 2.8% early, only to fall as much as 1.4% later. But that was about it.None of the other semiconductors got a lift from Oracle.Everything else in the group is down, including STMicro, off 4.6% at midday, and Taiwan Semiconductor, lower by 2%. Elsewhere, banks, a former leadership group, have been trending down for the past week, and at midmorning, we got word of third-quarter guidance from JPMorgan Chase at a Barclays conference, where it said net interest income expectations for 2025 were \"too high.\" Stock in the country's largest bank immediately sold off, and was recently down 7%. That alone is chopping about 100 points off the Dow Industrials. But Goldman Sachs , down about 5%, is also knocking about 160 points off the Dow. These were two major leadership stocks in the S & P 500. Both were at historic highs going into September  not anymore. Even regional banks such as Regions Financial , which opened up, reversed course and are now lower. The issues facing the market are well known:weak seasonals through October, concerns about a slowing jobs market and valuations that are still on the high side. Put this all together, and it reinforces the view that there is no reason to stick your neck out."

        "header": "Bears are eager to front-run a recession that has not materialized",
        "content": "Let's front-run the recession. That seems to be the attitude of some investors at the start of September. Never mind the economic data does not support such doom and gloom. It's certainly not in the August nonfarm payrolls , which came in at 142,000, slightly below expectations of 162,000 but better than Citi's much lower estimate of 125,000 released Tuesday. There were downward revisions in June and July. The unemployment rate came in at 4.2%, in line with expectations. Bottom line: This data continues to support the soft landing. The soft-landing scenario holds that the economy is indeed slowing down, but not going into a tailspin. Some investors  bulls have taken to calling them \"recessionistas\"  seem hell-bent on finding something, anything, that indicates something far more sinister is happening. The recessionistas have been making such predictions every September and October for the past two years. They have been wrong  very wrong. Someday they will be right, but it is not at all clear that this is their moment. Unfortunately, the \"recessionistas\" are not the only problem for markets. Let's front-run the September-October weakness Another chunk of investors is equally pessimistic, but for a different reason. They are agnostic on a recession but their attitude is, \"Let's front-run the typical September-October slowdown,\" and at least on that front they have history on their side, especially the past four years. S & P 500 in September: It's been ugly recently (rounded) 2023: down 5% 2022: down 9% 2021: down 5% 2020: down 4% Traders have been passing around factoids for several weeks, noting that: 1) September is not only the weakest month of the year, but the second half of September is the worst two-week trading period of the year for the S & P 500, according to Goldman Sachs. 2) Corporate buybacks, which have been exceptionally strong this year  likely a record for the S & P 500  will likely slow soon because corporations will be entering blackout periods for several weeks heading into earnings. Seeing this, you might think the whole world has descended into madness and despair, but you would be wrong. The S & P 500 is less than 3% from its historic high. Most sentiment indicators still indicate fairly high levels of bullishness. And look at the volumes: Bulls have been trying to buy the dip all week but the firepower is not there. Volumes have been light. Aside from Tuesday , this has been largely a buyer's strike, not a seller frenzy. Because valuations are still high, the 'pain trade' is down The biggest problem is the market is still expensive, and the price drops this week have not put a big dent in overall valuations. The pain trade is the trade that would cause the greatest discomfort to the most traders. Since valuations are high  still 20x forward earnings for the S & P 500  and most traders remain on the bullish side, even as prices have been lower this week, the pain trade is for the markets to decline further. Two pieces of good news for bulls: 1) The market has already been softened up a bit by the belief that the job market is slowing . Citi did that for everyone with their Tuesday call that August nonfarm payrolls would come in at 125,000, below the 162,000 consensus. 2) For some key tech stocks, valuations have become far more reasonable. Take Nvidia , which is now 24% from its June high. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia shares year to date I have emphasized for two weeks that the key to Nvidia is that investors are taking down the multiple on Nvidia, not the earnings. The forward multiple for Nvidia's current fiscal year (February 2024 to February 2025) is now at 37.9  well below the 48 multiple in June. The forward multiple for Nvidia's next fiscal year (February 2025 to February 2026) is 26.5  well below the 36 multiple in June. The recessionistas still have the rhetorical upper hand The bottom line is that the information so far is not recessionary, but the \"recessionistas\" seem to have the rhetorical upper hand. Maybe everyone should just relax and enjoy the correction. It's been a while. The last time the S & P 500 had a 10% correction was July 31 to Oct. 27, 2023 (10.3% drop). We came close last month, down 9.7% on an intraday basis. That's what happens with high valuations and a slower economy."

        "content": "Yesterday, commodity weakness in metals was widely attributed to Goldman Sachs, which cut its copper forecast because of projected weakness in China. Then there was concern that the August jobs report, out this Friday, was going to be weaker than expected (stop me if you've heard this before). Citigroup led the downside charge, putting out a call out for 125,000 jobs, far below consensus expectations for a gain of 161,000. This happens all the time now. Bulls cynically call it \"the recessionista crowd,\" those folks who insist there is a serious slowdown coming. You can't blame the bulls for being cynical.Bears have been insisting we are going into a recession for the last two years. Now we are heading into another seasonally weak September-October, accompanied by new cries that a recession is imminent. Someday, the \"recessionistas\" are going to be right.But they've been terribly wrong for two years, and anyone trying to time a recession would have lost a lot of money. Every jobs number moves markets now In the meantime, every data point on jobs is a potentially market moving event.Even the weekly initial jobless claims, out every Thursday and not traditionally a market mover, is watched carefully now. This week, markets are expecting roughly 230,000 in jobless claims.What was it a year ago? About 234,000, almost exactly the same. We know the most likely playbook:if the data comes in better than feared, the Fed will cut 25 basis points and the market will rally. If the jobs data is weak, the market will panic again, but bulls have not abandoned the reasonable assumption that there is indeed a Fed \"put\" that will provide some kind of floor under the market, even if it is 5%-10% below the current level. Tom Lee from Fundstrat, who has been directionally correct all year, is in this camp.He told CNBC yesterday that stocks could see a 7%-10% pullback this fall, but then added that investors should be ready to \"buy that dip.\" Nvidia's multiple is falling, not its earnings Meanwhile, there was much gnashing and wailing around Nvidia 's big 9% drop yesterday. An old friend, veteran trader Joe Zicherman, called me near the close and said this may be the biggest one-day dollar loss ever for a single stock, and he appears to be correct. Nvidia lost $279 billion in market value Tuesday. This looks like a record for a single day dollar loss in one stock.Previous big losses include Meta and Amazon in 2022. Big one-day losses Nvidia $279 billion (9/3/24) Meta: $232 billion (2/3/22) Amazon: $207 billion (4/29/22) These $200 billion dollar down days are getting to be a bit of a habit with Nvidia.CNBC's Robert Hum tells me this is the 5th time Nvidia has lost more than $200 billion in one session. But remember: they are taking down the multiple on Nvida, not the earnings. The forward multiple for Nvidia's current fiscal year (February 2024-February 2025) is now at 38.3, well below the 48 multiple in June.The forward multiple for Nvidia's next fiscal year (February 2025-February 2026) is 28.8, well below the 36 multiple in June. Not so the earnings estimates, which have been rising for all quarters for the foreseeable future, though as we have been noting, at a far more modest pace than last year. Nvidia is down again early Wednesday after reports of a DOJ subpoena around an antitrust probe . While Nvidia is certainly not a value stock, it is much more reasonably priced than it was two months ago."

        "header": "Here\u2019s why September and October are historically weak for stocks",
        "content": "Why are September and October historically weak for stocks?For answers, I turned to Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of the book,  Investing in U.S. Financial Histor y:  Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future . The answers have been edited for clarity. What is it with September and October being weak months for stocks? Has this always been the case? Yes. The most intense panics on Wall Street have tended to occur during the late summer and early autumn months. This can be traced all the way back to the 1800s. A few notable examples of exceptional panics include Black Friday of 1869, the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1907. But why September and October? It is a byproduct of an old weakness in the U.S. financial system. Prior to the reintroduction of a central banking system with the passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the U.S. was limited in its ability to adjust the money supply in response to market conditions. The inelasticity of the U.S. currency made the late summer and early autumn months an especially precarious time, due to the agricultural financing cycle. In the 1800s, the U.S. economy still relied heavily on agricultural production. For the first eight months of the year, American farmers had a limited need for capital, so excess funds held on deposit in state banks were shipped to New York banks or trust companies to earn a higher rate of return. When harvest time arrived in August, state banks began withdrawing their capital from New York, as farmers drew on their accounts to fund transactions required to ship crops to market. The agricultural financing cycle created chronic shortages of cash in New York City during the autumn months. If these shortages happened to coincide with a financial shock, there was little flexibility in the system to prevent a panic. How did the government respond to these panics? The limited ability of the government to react was the primary impetus for the passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The Act granted the Fed the power to serve as a lender of last resort during financial crises. Prior to the Act, leading financiers (most notably J.P. Morgan) were forced to assemble ad hoc solutions that relied primarily on private capital. After the U.S. barely avoided a catastrophic collapse of the financial system during the Panic of 1907, there was just enough political support for the return of the third and final iteration of a central banking system in the United States. Did the creation of the Federal Reserve provide more stability to markets?  Yes, and if one compares the frequency, intensity and misery of financial panics during the 1800s, this is plainly evident. In fairness, the Fed made a few mistakes along the way, with the most notable being its failure to stop the contagion of bank failures in the 1930s. But, by and large, the U.S. financial system has been much more stable since the Federal Reserve became operational in late 1914. Still, the U.S. economy is not primarily agricultural anymore. Why are September and October still weak months? People tend to fear things that have happened before even if they dont remember the origin of the fear. It may be that the fall panics have repeated so many times that they have become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words, people expect them, and because they expect them, they behave in ways (i.e., reducing risk in late summer and early fall) that make them more likely. I know this sounds like a stretch, but it does seem like it may actually be real."

        "content": "Believe it or not, its tough being Nvidia . The dominant maker of processors for use in artificial intelligence has soared 720% since ChatGPT was introduced in Nov. 2022. Its seen the biggest gain in the S & P 500 this year too, up 160% heading into its earnings results Wednesday evening. At $3.16 trillion, it is now the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock market, just behind Apples $3.46 trillion.Earnings and revenues have doubled in the past year. Nvidia has not only grown earnings and revenues, it has consistently surprised Wall Street, beating on the top and bottom lines for six straight quarters. And thats the problem:Wall Street has come to believe that beats and raises are part of the DNA for Jensen Huangs company. Its hard to keep raising the bar, Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management noted on CNBC Tuesday. Most analysts remain bullish, but agree its getting tougher to impress Wall Street. The outperformance of the stock...indicates a high bar for execution, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said in a recent note to clients. Its not just that its getting tougher to beat expectations.Two other warning flags have become evident in the last two quarters. Slowing rate of change in earnings growth There are two important trends to follow in earnings.The first is whether earnings are going up or down. But the second trend is just as important:whether the trend is accelerating or decelerating. If earnings for XYZ stock were rising 5% in 2022, then rising 10% in 2023, and are expected to rise 15% in 2024, that is good because: 1) earnings are going up, and 2) the rate of change of the earnings is increasing. In the case of Nvidia, earnings are continuing to increase, but the rate of change is decelerating. Nvidia earnings (year-over-year % change) Feb. 2025 (est.) + 52% Nov. 2024 (est.) + 77% Aug. 2024 (est.) + 138% May 2024 + 461% Feb. 2024 + 486% Nov. 2023 + 593% Aug. 2023 + 429% Source: LSEG You can see Nvidias peak change in year-over-year earnings growth occurred toward the end of last year, and has been rapidly declining since.This earnings reportwill likely be the final time in this stretch that Nvidia will see triple-digit earnings growth. Another issue: even though Nvidias stock price is up, the earnings multiple (P/E ratio), or how much an investor is willing to pay for a future stream of earnings, has also increased. The forward multiple has increased from 40 times earnings to 47 for this fiscal year (February 2024-February 2025), and from 23 to 33 for the following fiscal year (February 2025-February 2026). For fundamental investors, both of these signs (decelerating earnings growth, higher multiple) are cautionary flags. There are some things Ive learned in my two decades on Wall Street:when youve got expensive valuations and decelerating growth rates from astronomical valuations, there is not a lot of margin for error, Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC at the end of June, while discussing Nvidias earnings growth. Magnitude of earnings beats getting smaller Another set of numbers that have gotten smaller  the magnitude of Nvidias beats is getting smaller.This indicates analysts are getting caught off-guard to a lesser extent than they were in prior quarters.Its a sign its getting tougher to impress Wall Street. Nvidia: earnings surprises are getting smaller (earnings beat) May 2024: 10% Feb. 2024: 11% Nov. 2023 19% Aug. 2023 29% Source: LSEG Nvidias impact on S & P 500 earnings also slowing Nvidia earnings are still the most important of the season. But the impact has been shrinking  just as the overall Mag 7 impact has been diminishing with second quarter earnings growth broadening out. Last season (Q1), Nvidia was responsible for a little more than one-third of the S & P 500s 8% earnings growth. This quarter though, its expected to make up just 16% of the indexs nearly 13% growth. There are two major issues for Nvidia:will spending on AI continue at its breakneck pace, even if profitability is elusive, and will Nvidia be able to keep rolling out new and innovative products? On the AI spending front, despite concerns about an air pocket in demand, Nvidias largest customers continue to keep spending. Microsoft and Meta Platforms , two of Nvidias largest customers, have indicated spending remains strong. Neither one of them have given any indication they are lessening their orders to Nvidia, Josh Brown noted, adding that 45% of Microsofts capital expenditures are going to Nvidia. Analysts agree that spending remains strong. With U.S. cloud and social media companies pointing to data center (and particularly AI) investment as the catalyst for increased spending, and reiterating their commitment to investing in AI we see this shift as boding well for NVDAs CQ2 results, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said, raising his fiscal second quarter estimates. As for new product, there have been concerns about delays in Nvdias Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU), which is supposed to deliver much faster performance than its Hopper predecessor, and was supposed to be released in 2024. CEO Huang had previously said he expected to see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year. Analysts seem unconcerned about any potential delays in the Blackwell GPUs. Our discussions with industry participants suggest that potential delays are likely to be measured in months rather than quarters, Stifel said in a note to clients last week.We are confident that the Blackwell delay will be resolved, and not prove materially detrimental to NVDA or any one of its multitude of industry partners. Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis, in a note to clients, said while a negative announcement could have a negative 5%-to-10% near term impact to the stock, NVDA has proven adept at quickly comingup with alternative solutions.Furthermore, should a delay manifest, we believe demand is so strong ... that current generation Hopper solutions would be purchased even if Blackwell was pushed. The ramp of the H200 [GPU] and forthcoming Blackwell launch likely means AI demand outstrips supply through at least mid-calendar 2025, asGenerative AI and investments in large languagemodels are driving robust demand, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said in a recent note. Most believe AI ramp in early stages Ultimately whether you are a bull or a bear on Nvidia depends on where you believe we are in the  AI ramp . Most analysts remain believers that we are at the start of a much larger ramp, a position long maintained by tech uber-bull Dan Ives at Wedbush. While investors may fret about this massive spending wave and frustrated that top-line growth/margins from these investments could take time to materialize this ultimately speaks to our view this is a 1995 (almost 1996) start of the Internet Moment and not a 1999 Tech Bubble-like moment, Ives said. And that is what keeps the true believers buying, despite the warning flags. Any earnings disappointment from Nvidia has been an unbelievable opportunity to buy over the long term, Brown said."

        "content": "The bad news is that September is the worst month of the year, but there's plenty of good news to balance out the bad. The bad news: seasonality and the elections September is the worst month of the year for the Dow Industrials, S & P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. \"While momentum usually overrides seasonal concerns, September is hard to ignore  it is the only month down on average,\" Frank Gretz from Wellington Shields said in a Friday note to clients. The last four Septembers have been particularly ugly. September is the only month that has been lower in each of the past 4 years, our Robert Hum tells me. S & P 500 in September:It's been ugly recently (rounded) 2023: down 5% 2022: down 9% 2021: down 5% 2020: down 4% The elections are another wildcard. Many traders believe the outcome will not be known for some time after the November 5th election, adding a layer of risk to what is normally the start of a seasonally strong period. The good news outweighs the bad Seasonality aside, the market is riding a wave of momentum, and with good reason: 1) The market \"broadening\" trend is very real. Two-thirds of the S & P 500 was up in August. The NYSE advance/decline line hit an all-time high. More than 70% of the stocks on the NYSE are above their 200-day moving average. Most importantly, the Equal-Weight S & P 500 (RSP) modestly outperformed the S & P 500 in August and closed Friday at an historic high. Megacap Tech did not have a bad month, but aside from Meta it was not a leadership group: Megacap tech: lackluster August Meta up 9.8% Apple up 3.1% Nvidia up 2.0% Microsoft down 0.3% Alphabet down 4.5% Amazon down 4.6% Other sectors were leaders: Sectors in August Consumer Staples up 5.8% Real Estate up 5.6% Health Care up 5.0% Utilities up 4.4% Technology up 1.1% 2) Earnings remain strong. Earnings topped 13% growth in the second quarter and are expected to remain strong for the rest of the year. 2024 S & P earnings: still strong Q2: up 13.0% Q3est. : up 5.7% Q4 est.: up 13.5% 2025 est.: up 15% Source: LSEG These numbers have not changed appreciably in several months. 3) Sentiment is bullish but not wildly so. The weekly poll of members of the American Association of Individual Investors indicates bullishness at 51.2%, above the long term average of 37.5%, but that's mostly because a chunk of people who were neutral have become more optimistic. Bearish sentiment is not far off from its historic average. Bulls vs. Bears Bullish: 51.2% (avg. 37.5%) Neutral: 21.9% (avg. 31.5%) Bearish: 27.0% (avg. 31.0%) Source: AAII 4)Inflation is waning. The July Core PCE, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, dropped to 2.5%, within reach of the Fed's 2% inflation target. Is the \"Fed put\" back? Another important support for markets: Fed rate cuts are expected. At Jackson Hole, chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that the Fed had shifted its attention from fighting inflation to the job market. According to the CME FedWatch, the vast majority of traders (69.5%) believe the Fed will cut 25 basis points in September, 32% believe a 50 basis point cut is possible. It makes sense most traders don't think the Fed needs to be very aggressive yet: with the job market still relatively strong, most traders don't expect the Fed to get aggressive unless it has to. \"I'm a little concerned if they did something more aggressive, as much as 50 basis points, because I'm concerned that market participants may view that as the Fed seeing something scary in their economic data and are moving aggressively to get in front of that,\" David Smith, chief investment officer at Rockland Trust, said in an interview on CNBC on Friday. Still, most market observers believe that any sign of significant job deterioration will likely be met with more rate cuts from the Fed. This belief in a Fed \"put\" is helping support the bull position that any sell-off around job deterioration will be short lived as the Fed is helping put a floor under the market."

        "header": "The explosion of online sports betting is taking a toll on how people invest ",
        "content": "The explosion of online sports betting is taking a toll on personal finances, particularly among those who are financially distressed. That's the conclusion of a recent paper,  \"Gambling Away Stability: Sports Betting's Impact on Vulnerable Households. \" The authors found that sports betting has exploded since the Supreme Court overturned a federal law prohibiting it in 2018. Since then, 38 states have legalized it and it has become a growth industry, generating more than $120 billion in total bets and $11 billion in revenue in 2023 alone. That has put considerable sums into state coffers, but it has come at a notable personal expense to gamblers and their families. Those who participate tend to invest less and have higher debt levels. \"Our results show that not only does sports betting lead to increased betting activity, but it also leads to higher credit card balances, less available credit, a reduction in net investments, and an increase in lottery play,\" the authors concluded. The authors noted these negative effects were particularly noticeable among \"financially constrained households.\" That term was not defined, but the implication is that this group typically has lower savings, lower cash levels to cover expenses, higher debt levels and lower net worth. The authors used a quarterly panel of 230,171 households in states that have legalized gambling. About 7.7% of the households made online sports bets, with a household average of $1,100 a year. Not surprisingly, people who gamble on sports have less money to invest, particularly in the stock market. The authors found a large decrease in net deposits to traditional brokerage accounts. \"Two to three years after betting becomes legal, there is a noticeable drop in net investment relative to states where betting is not yet legal,\" the report said. The authors estimate that legalization reduces net investments by bettors by nearly 14%, and that every dollar spent on sports betting reduces net investment by $2.13. But the implications are much broader. \"The increase in betting and consumption drives an increase in financial instability in terms of decreased credit availability, increased credit card debt, and a higher incidence rate of overdrawing bank accounts,\" the authors said. This is particularly true for financially constrained households. The higher credit card debt indicates that these households are not just shifting funds from one type of entertainment to another (for example, shifting money from betting on lotteries to betting on sports). Instead, they are \"becoming more indebted to fund an addictive losing proposition.\" Again, lower-income households suffer disproportionately. The bottom one-third of households by income had the largest increase in spending on sports gambling relative to income. There were notable differences between the characteristics of bettors and nonbettors. Both groups had similar incomes, but bettors displayed riskier behavior. They were more than twice as likely as nonbettors to have ever invested in crypto or ever overdrawn their bank account. They were four times more likely to have played online poker or purchased lottery tickets. These results are consistent with several prior studies. One  2009 study  concluded gamblingrelated activity is greater among lowincome investors, who tend to excessively bet on state lotteries and also are overweight risky, lotterytype stocks. The authors note the quandary for policymakers. By continuing to legalize and expand activities such as sports gambling  where the vast majority lose money  the government is sending conflicting signals. On one hand, the government attitude is: These are adults, they have a right to spend their money any way they want to. And we need the money. But governments have other priorities they are promoting, including encouraging saving money for retirement, that are clearly in conflict with promoting gambling. \"As legalized sports betting gains traction, it potentially undermines government efforts aimed at promoting savings through tax incentives and financial literacy programs,\" the authors concluded. \"Policymakers should consider how the allure of betting might divert funds from savings and investment accounts, particularly for constrained households, which can affect household financial stability and long-term wealth accumulation.\""

CNBC's Robert Hum tells me both the S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up eight straight sessions  the longest advances since November of last year for the S & P 500 and December for the Nasdaq. The S & P has risen 7% over the past eight trading days. That would be its strongest eight-day win streak since the nearly 12% rally in March 2003. Another positive factor:market breadth (advancing vs. declining stocks) has been on a tear. Lowry, the nation's oldest technical analysis service, noted on Friday that the New York Stock Exchange advance/decline line hit an all-time high on Aug. 15.That is one of the best technical signals you can get. It's hard to argue there is a market top with the advance/decline line at an all-time high. Markets now It's happening again Monday:2-1 advancing to declining stocks on the NYSE, and the S & P 500 ahead 25 points. Tech is lagging but, elsewhere, defensive stocks are strong, with real estate, health care and consumer staples leading. The tech rally appears to have stalled out.Big-cap tech is mixed today, with particular weakness in semis. There is a fairlywide dispersion this month among big-cap tech, with Meta and Nvidia up, Apple flattish and Alphabet and Amazon both down in mid-single digits. Megacap tech this month Meta + 11.2% Nvidia +6.0% Apple +1.0% Alphabet -3.6% Amazon -5.0% Where are we? On the positive side, the soft landing scenario is still intact: Economic data shows some slowing but job growth IS still strong, the Fed is expected to begin cutting rates in a few weeks and earnings have been remarkably stable, even if some companies are experiencing pricing pressure.Perhaps most importantly, the recent volatility in early August caused a significant unwind of many crowded trades, including parts of the yen carry trade , that may help make markets a little less volatile. Market positives Economic data supportive of growth Fed easing expected Earnings stable Partial unwind of crowded trades On the negative side, other than the week after Christmas, the next two weeks are the lightest volume days of the year, when volume typically drops 20% below average. Also, September to October remain among the worst months of the year.Finally, although earnings growth expectations remain strong at roughly 10% this year and 15% next year, valuations are still very high, leaving little room for error. Market negatives End of August: Traditionally light volume September to October rough months Valuations high: little room for error"

The real issue for the market was an emerging growth slowdown narrative, and fears about how far it would go. Todays retail sales report (up 1.0% month over month, up 0.4% ex-autos, well above expectations of an 0.3% and 0.1% gain, respectively) and strong commentary on the consumer by Walmart reinforces that the consumer may be slowing, but is still resilient. Bottom line: the soft landing is very much alive. Where the markets are now The S & P 500 has executed a complete round trip, from roughly 5,500 just prior to the jobs report, to the 5,186 close on Aug. 5, and now back to roughly 5,500. .SPX 1M mountain S & P 500 Index over the past month.

This has all happened while market sentiment has remained mostly neutral. One investor sentiment gauge, the weekly survey of investors for the American Association of Individual Investors, is largely neutral: Bulls vs. Bears (AAII weekly survey, ended Aug. 14) Bullish 42.5% (historic avg. 37.5%) Neutral 28.6% (historic avg. 31.5%) Bearish 28.9% (historic avg. 31.0%) Source: AAII During periods of euphoria, bullish levels go into the low 50s, so a reading in the low 40s is well below euphoria. Lets look at other measures of the market: Inflation: Trending lower Interest rates: Rate cuts expected Growth: Slowing but no recession (Atlanta Fed projects Q3 GDP at 2.9%) Earnings: Holding The fact that earnings growth estimates are holding up is critical. S & P 500 earnings growth of 10% is expected in 2024, and 15% growth is seen for 2025. These estimates are little changed in recent months. True, revenue growth hasnt been as strong, and much of the reason earnings are holding up is cost cutting. That, and the need for more revenue, is a clear issue for 2025. Regardless, inflation is moderating. Growth is slowing, but no recession is apparent Interest rate cuts coming and earnings are still holding up. That is practically the definition of the soft landing. If none of that impresses you, here is Walmart CFO John David Rainey in a CNBC interview: In this environment, its responsible or prudent to be a little bit guarded with the outlook, but were not projecting a recession."

The July consumer price index report was the last hurdle needed to give the all-clear for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September.Prices excluding food and energy rose 0.2% month over month, in line with expectations. Year on year, they gained 3.2%  also in line. The CME FedWatch tool, which measures market expectations for changes in the federal funds rate, shows a 58.5% probability of a 25 basis-point cut in rates in September and a 41.5% chance for a 50 basis-point cut. Investors are betting on lower rates in Treasurys as well.JPMorgan's Treasury client survey showed net long positions among clients at their highest since December, Bloomberg News reported . Stocks are opening up, with semiconductors  which are the tip of the spear for any broad rally  leading. This is the second day in a row that stocks have reacted with relief to an inflation report.Yesterday's July PPI pushed stocks up.That rally was so strong that Home Depot, which gave disappointing guidance for the year in its earnings report and was down in premarket trading, rose on the inflation report and ended the day up 1.2%. Where are we? The S & P 500 is now back to where it was just before the disappointing jobs report on Aug. 2.The S & P technology sector ETF (XLK) is also back to levels before the jobs report. Tech bellwether Nvidia is trading above its close on Aug. 1. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has collapsed to 17  also where it was just before the jobs report. Despite the growth scare that followed the jobs report, there are no signs of an imminent recession.The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model estimates GDP growth of 2.9% for the third quarter. Earnings are remaining steady.Third-quarter estimates for the S & P 500 are slightly lower than when the quarter began (up 13.6% year-over-year vs. up 14.8% on July 1), but that is entirely normal. Estimates tend to decline after the first month of the quarter, as analysts adjust overly-optimistic estimates.Overall estimates for 2024 are little changed (up 10.5% year-over-year) and for 2025 as well (up 14.9%). So, what do we have?We have easing inflation; a modest growth scare that has markets betting on easing; and a modest valuation reset in tech that is quickly reversing. Seems like the softish-landing scenario is still alive, with investors quickly snapping up part of the market that were 5% cheaper a few days ago. We'll see about retail sales, due Thursday.That metric has been trending lower.Investors are convinced there is a slowdown in the consumer, and based on earnings reports, there is good reason to have that concern. That could be a catalyst for another modest sell-off. For the moment, it seems like a hard sell to argue to bail out of stocks.We may not have a big reason to move to new highs, but relief on inflation is the big story."

        "content": "Despite the S & P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting recent record highs, the initial public offering market remains stuck in neutral. However, two large deals are likely coming to market soon. First, chip manufacturer Cerebras Systems is expected to announce its IPO imminently.The company specializes in manufacturing semiconductors that are optimized for artificial intelligence. It will likely seek to raise $750 million to $1 billion , making it one of the larger IPOs of the year. Second, aircraft maintenance services provider StandardAero upsized its IPO offering on Friday, which is expected to start trading at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 2. This company services all the original equipment manufacturers, including GE Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, Honeywell and Safran. The company is seeking to sell 60 million shares at a price range of $20 to $23 per share. StandardAero previously filed to offer 46.5 million shares at the same $20 to $23 per share range. StandardAero will be a large IPO, likely raising about $1.3 billion at the midpoint. This would make it the fourth largest IPO of the year, behind temperature-controlled warehouse real estate investment trust Lineage ( $4.4 billion ), cruise line Viking ( $1.5 billion ) and athletic company Amer Sports ( $1.37 bilion ) For reference, the majority of IPOs in the U.S. raise $100 million to $500 million. There have been more than 100 IPOs this year, and only four have raised $1 billion or more. The StandardAero deal is backed by investment firm Carlyle.Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC is also a major backer and will also be selling shares. IPOs stuck in neutral IPOs in 2024 are running above last year's figures, but they are still way below normal levels. So far this year, 104 IPOs have raised $24.7 billion.A normal year would see roughly $50 billion in IPO proceeds.The IPO raise has been sub-par for three years running. IPOs in 2024 # of IPOs: 104 Raise: $24.7 billion Typical year: $50 billion to $60 billion Source: Renaissance Capital Still, hope springs eternal.IPO watchers note childcare provider KinderCare and digital health marketplace company Solera both could raise $500 million or more. Lubricant company Moove could also be an IPO candidate. StubHub , SeatGeek , and Ingram Micro also are possibilities, along with Dunkin' Brands-owner Inspire Brands."

        "header": "A guide to the wild week of trading, from Monday's 'flash crash' to the yen to the volatility spike",
        "content": "Let's breakdown all the wild market action from this week and how investors at home should evaluate it. Low macro visibility is causing big problems. True, there is not a lot of confidence in a soft landing, but investors are all over the map on where the economy is going. Because of that, it has turned into a good news/bad news market. Watching the yen Here's the good news:We appear to be decoupling from the Japanese yen carry trade. The currency strengthened dramatically into Monday on fears of higher rates in Japan, but Bank of Japan officials appear to have blinked, affirming they would not be raising rates when the market is this unstable. FXY 5D mountain Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust The exchange-traded fund of the week, the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (FXY) , which tracks the price of the yen, has dropped two days in a row. This indicates the currency is declining. Watching Wall Street's 'fear gauge' And now the bad news:The muddy macro outlook, combined with a weak seasonal period, will likely keep the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) elevated. With Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" still near 30,investors are expecting twice as much daily volatility as when the VIX is at 15, which was only a few weeks ago. .VIX YTD mountain Cboe Volatility Index in 2024 That is literally what the VIX measures:expectations for volatility over the next 30 days.The VIX futures curve remains in backwardation . That is, the price of the cash VIX and front-month VIX futures contracts (August, September and October) are higher than contracts that are further out. That is unusual, and it's a sign that investors expect concerns about the macro environment and seasonality to persist for the next several months. Traditionally, August through October marks the weakest period of the year. Watching the economy The good news:The consensus still seems to be that currently we are not in a recession, which JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon affirmed on our air Wednesday afternoon. The bad news: The economy is slowing  it's just not clear how much.Travel and hotel companies have indicated a modest slowdown is underway. Correction vs. 'flash crash' vs. bear market The good news: So far, this is a garden-variety correction, with the S & P 500 down roughly 10% from its all-time high at Monday's low of the session. There is an old saying: The difference between a correction and a bear market is that a correction is about people worrying about bad things happening. A bear market is where bad things really do happen. \"We have the former, but not the latter,\" Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, told me. Was Monday a 'flash crash'? I bet you haven't heard that phrase in a long time.A \"flash crash\" is a sudden and severe price drop that lasts for a very short period, usually a few hours. Is that what happened on Monday?Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of \"Investing in U.S. Financial History: Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future ,\" thinks it might fit the criteria. \"It appears that the sell-off of August 5th qualified as a flash crash, although it was rather modest by historical standards,\" he told me. Whatever you want to call what happened on Monday, a key lesson during these periods of market turbulence is that most investors should do absolutely nothing . \"The same thing [panics over real or imagined recessions] has happened not only before but multiple times before,\" Higgins, a student of financial history, told me. Almost invariably, selling during panics is a mistake for long-term investors. Don't let your emotions get the best of you, Higgins said.His best advice: Act like you're 200 years old and you have seen this all before. \"If you think like a 2-year-old you are going to do dumb things,\" Higgins said. \"A 2-year-old sees everything for the first time.If you think like a 2-year-old, you're going to overreact.\" \"Instead, think like a 200-year-old,\" he said. \"If you're 200 years old, you've seen this many times before. You're better off sticking to a long-term plan.\" Higgins retold a story about an investor during the October 1987 crash , which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 22.6%. \"My family ran funeral homes for about 150 years,\" he told me. During the 1987 flash crash, Higgins said an investor was trying to orchestrate trades on the phone while he was preparing to go to his relative's funeral. \"His uncle [who was a police officer] pinned him against the wall and threatened to punch him out if he didn't hang up the phone and get in the limo to go to church,\" Higgins told me. \"Not only did it spare him alienation from the family, but it also probably saved him a lot of money,\" he said."

        "header": "The yen carry trade unwind: A big complication for global markets",
        "content": "The Nikkei 225 recovered Tuesday, up 10.2%, following a drop of 12% on Monday. That drop, the worst drop for the Japanese stock market since 1987, was about much more than a slowdown in the U.S. economy and whether global stocks should have their multiples lowered. That might be worth a 2%-4% drop. Those losses were largely about the yen carry trade. In its simplest form, the yen carry trade has investors borrowing cheap yen to invest in higher yielding assets, often currencies. When there is a big differential in interest rates, like 4% in the U.S. versus nearly zero in Japan, the trade can seem like free money. But it can go bad very quickly if interest rates begin to change. A bigger issue is how opaque the whole business is. How big is the yen carry trade? For example, because there is not a central source to track currency trades, we have no idea how big the yen carry trade is. But it is big. The Wall Street Journal noted that Japanese banks foreign lending reached $1 trillion in March, a 21% rise from 2021. We have no idea where all the money goes. The common explanation is that some invest in currencies, some invest in equities. But we dont know. We also dont know who is using the carry trade. The typical answer is institutional investors or hedge funds. Thats certainly true, but we dont have a breakdown. Finally, we have no idea how much leverage is being used. These are lots of unknowns, but I would wager that the Federal Reserve, and the Bank of Japan, were a bit shocked at a 12% drop in the Nikkei. How the yen carry trade works The heart of the problem is that Japanese central bankers have been talking about higher interest rates. The yen is rising, and that is making the yen carry trade less profitable. Heres a simple example. XYZ Hedge Fund borrows 10 million yen, which up until recently was costing just a little above zero interest. It takes the proceeds and buys the U.S. dollar at 155 yen to the dollar, about where it was trading in July. The fund now has $64,516, where you can earn an interest rate north of 4%. It sounds like money for nothing. Things can go wrong because the fund still has borrowed 10 million yen and has to pay it back. If the value of the Japanese yen starts to strengthen, the fund has to repay that debt with more dollars. Remember that $64,516? If the yen goes from 155 to 145, which is where it traded Monday, it will take $68,965 to repay that 10 million yen (10 million yen divided by 145 = $68,965). All of a sudden, XYZ Hedge Fund has to cough up $4,449 of their own money to cover the debt ($68,965 - $64,516 = $4,449). And this is small potatoes. Some funds may have hundreds of millions of dollars in this trade. Leverage makes this even more complicated Much of this is being done on margin, where the hedge fund is borrowing money from a broker. If the value of the investment drops and the equity falls below the minimum established by the margin agreement, the broker may issue a margin call requiring the hedge fund to deposit more funds, or sell the securities. Deposit more funds means find more yen, or start selling. Given the 12% drop in the Nikkei on Monday, a lot of people were selling. The bottom line The price of financial assets are not just determined by valuation metrics like earnings and multiples. Flows  how much money is flowing into an asset class is also an important determinant. The yen carry trade has created enormous cross-market flows. It is likely a significant driver of flows into the U.S. dollar and global equities, including the U.S. stock market. It is certainly not unreasonable to believe that a significant unwind of this trade, should it continue, would be an additional headwind to U.S. equities. Its little wonder the always-astute Nicholas Colas at DataTrek noted that, Until the yen stabilizes, it is hard to see how global equity market volatility declines. One positive sign: the ETF to watch is the Invesco Japanese Yen ETF (FXY), which tracks the price of the Japanese yen, had volume six times normal yesterday. After rocketing up five days in a row, its down 0.6% on Tuesday on much lower volume."

        "header": "What the second-quarter earnings results are telling investors about the rest of 2024",
        "content": "With nearly three-fourths of the S & P 500 reporting second-quarter results, the earnings picture for the back half of the year is looking unusually complicated. It's been a 'meh' quarter so far We have the usual beat on bottom-line earnings, but revenue beats are below expectations.About 79% of S & P 500 are beating earnings expectations, and that is about average, according to LSEG. Two observations:First, the average beat is much smaller than it has been recently. We're seeing an average beat of about 4.5%, nearly half the 8% upside from the first quarter.Second, only 47% exceeded revenue forecasts, a lower percentage than normal, which suggests some pricing pressure. Companies not making bold calls on the second half It's a bit frustrating. Most companies are beating on earnings estimates but are declining to hike full-year guidance beyond the beat. Coca-Cola , GE Aerospace , Hasbro , Sherwin-Williams , Deckers Outdoor , AbbVie and Lockheed Martin all raised full-year guidance. However, they did so directly as a result of strong results in the latest quarter. A slew of other companies like AT & T , Verizon , Mattel , IBM and Chipotle simply reaffirmed their previously-announced forecasts for the year. It's a sign that despite a still-strong economy, there are too many variables at play and companies are simply taking a wait-and-see approach. Tech earnings are still growing but decelerating There have been an elevated number of tech misses this season, including Fair Isaac , CDW , Skyworks Solutions , Juniper Networks , Enphase Energy , NXP Semiconductors , Accenture and Oracle . More importantly, for big cap tech, earnings growth is decelerating from the huge gains seen in the past two years. A more cautious consumer has reduced many companies' pricing power For example, Procter & Gamble and Clorox have been hit by a double whammy: Price hikes are slowing and demand has been tepid. It has been a similar story for food companies, which have seen volumes fall amid greater price sensitivity from consumers. All the major food names this season  Hershey , Kraft Heinz , Mondelez , PepsiCo , ConAgra Brands , General Mills and J.M. Smucker  have all seen revenue misses on lower volumes. Meanwhile, fast-food restaurants continue to be under pressure to offer value to their guests. McDonald's had seen poor sales , but traffic improved once it launched its $5 value meal. Shake Shack saw stronger June and July sales trends as it has employed \"strategic promotions.\" Wendy's said value is \"critically important\" and touted its ability to offer value before some of its competitors. Further, while it continues to struggle , Starbucks said \"thoughtful promotions resonated with customers in our quest to offer enhanced value indicating that our action plans are starting to take hold.\" The high-end consumer is still spending, but some softness observed One of us (Bob) just returned from a five-day stay in Atlantic City: The casinos were mostly full, from the gaming tables to the restaurants. But Bank of America ran an interesting headline recently: \"Travel/Leisure Cracks Emerging.\" The firm noted sub-par performance in gaming ( Bally's missed on earnings, while MGM Resorts called out fiscal first quarter softness), parks ( Comcast 's parks missed) and hotels ( Host Hotels cut estimates. Marriott cut, as did timeshare company Marriott Vacations . Wyndham lowered guidance on revenue per available room). Airlines were also highlighted, with Allegiant , Ryanair and Spirit noting soft pricing. Plenty of complaints about a slowing China consumer A weak China economy has been a significant headwind for a number of global companies this season. Procter & Gamble's China sales tumbled 8% from a year ago as consumer spending slowed. PepsiCo also observed a cautious consumer there, and General Mills saw \"a real souring or downturn in consumer sentiment\" in the country. McDonald's and Starbucks saw negative same-store sales in the region. Visa said payment volumes slowed within China, while Marriott revealed that it was the only region that saw negative hotel revenues in the quarter. A highly-promotional environment in Greater China was a major factor in Nike 's cautious outlook for its new fiscal year. Despite more tepid domestic spending, there is evidence the Chinese consumer is instead preserving their spending for when they travel outside the country. Luxury names like Kering and LVMH noted that the Chinese are taking advantage of the weak yen and buying products in Japan. Further, while Macao performance was a disappointment for Las Vegas Sands , the casino operator said Chinese visitors are still flocking to its Marina Bay Sands property in Singapore. What's the risk to earnings in the second half? There are two significant macro risks: First, there's an inflation scare  a series of reports that suggest its higher than expected. Second, there's the possibility of a growth slowdown  that is, a downturn in jobs that is greater than anticipated or a consumer pullback that's greater than what we've already seen. We saw a modest growth slowdown scare with the weak ISM manufacturing index reading, particularly in the sub-par employment component. That caused a drop in bond yields Thursday. Here's the good news: So far, overall third-quarter estimates for the S & P 500 haven't moved much since the start of this earnings season."

        "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell ended a press conference in which he gave markets exactly what they anticipated he would say. The Fed left rates unchanged, noted that job growth was weaker but still strong and hinted it was slowly winning the war on inflation. Stocks have been positioned for a three-stage process from the Fed: 1) setting the stage for rate cuts at today's meeting, 2) examine data in the next month and perhaps fine-tune the response at the Jackson Hole conference in August, and 3) begin rate cuts in September. The first stage is unfolding as expected. Powell, in his press conference, said \"the labor market has come into better balance, and the unemployment rate remains low. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7% to 2.5%.\" If there was any doubt he was feeling better about inflation, Powell later said, \"we have growing confidence that we are on a sustainable path to two percent,\" the Fed's long-term target for inflation. That's exactly what the markets wanted to hear.Markets are now pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut in September. What's next? The good news is the two or three months leading up to a rate cut are usually good for the markets. Next up: the July jobs report on Friday, and then Jackson Hole in late August. The risk to the market is we may get a series of aberrant inflation reports that would keep rates high and cause Powell to make cautious comments at Jackson Hole. Maybe, but it seems unlikely. We are not hearing about weird outlying signals.We are not hearing about skyrocketing rents, or airfares or hotel rooms.The inflation data seems to be narrowing. It's also possible we may see sudden economic deterioration, but that too seems unlikely, and at any rate that would drive rates even lower. Despite the fact that August is usually a rocky month, and assuming the data is unsurprising, the most-likely path is more of the same, more of the rotation we have seen for the past several weeks. Remember what happened in July That said, this is a very tricky time for the markets, and if you doubt that, look at what has happened over the past three weeks. The consensus as we entered July was that inflation was still a very real danger and that the Fed may keep rates higher. Investors were flocking to high-price tech stocks and ignoring everything else. On July 11, the June CPI report came out, which showed inflation moderating more than expected. Boom.Turned out the consensus was wrong.Inflation wasn't such a clear and continuing danger, and a lot of investors were caught offside.Megacap tech sold off and investors turned to small caps and value stocks instead. Ten-year yields have gone to 4.12% today from 4.28%. That trend continues today. If the consensus can be wrong about something as big as where the Fed is going, it certainly argues for everyone to be a lot more humble about their opinions going into the notoriously difficult month of August."

        "header": "The big issue for stocks: How real is the recession risk?     ",
        "content": "Recession fears are growing on Wall Street after the release of disappointing U.S. economic data and a global market sell-off that led to the biggest one-day drop in the Japanese Nikkei 225 going back to 1987. But how real is that risk? Much depends on where you guess the economy is going: There is not a necessary relationship between earnings and U.S. GDP growth (many companies have large international operations), but 2% GDP growth is often associated with earnings growth of 6%-10%. It's about earnings growth and the forward multiple S & P 500 earnings are expected to be up roughly 15% next year, well above the average, which usually hovers a few points above or below 10%. S & P 500 earnings estimates: 2024: $243.53 2025: $279.65 (up 14.8%) Source: LSEG That would require not just tech earnings to remain strong, but overall earnings would have to be above average. While there is room for some weakness, that would require a still-strong economy. If you think we are going into a recession, that estimate of 15% earnings growth is clearly wrong. But how wrong? If GDP contracts, earnings growth could go to zero or negative.That's what a recession is: negative GDP growth. During the last recession, in 2020, earnings growth dropped 13% year-over-year, though they recovered quickly in 2021. Another issue is the forward earnings multiple, or P/E ratio, which is a measure of how much investors are paying for $1 of future earnings.Using 2025 earnings estimates, the forward multiple has contracted considerably in the last two months, from a high of 20.8 to roughly 19.1 now. Even with a lower multiple, anything near 20 is reflective of an expanding economy, not a contracting economy, so that would also be wrong in the event of a recession. A typical recessionary multiple can be anywhere from 13-16. What's amazing about multiples is that it can contract even when earnings are rising. S & P 500 earnings were up 5% between 2021 and 2022 and a measly 1% between 2022 and 2023, but the forward multiple collapsed from the low 20s to 16 in the middle of 2022. What happened?Everyone was convinced we were going into another recession as the Fed raised rates to combat inflation. But it didn't happen.No recession.Still, the S & P 500 ended the year down 18%. How to game this out? First, a garden variety correction (down 10%), would bring the S & P 500 to about 5,100, about 200 points below where it is now. Beyond that, tell me roughly where the GDP is going to be, and we can bat around earnings and multiple estimates. Let's sketch out four scenarios. The current scenario, where we are now, has 2025 earnings growth at 15%, with a multiple of 19.1. The S & P 500 is at roughly 5,346 ($243.53 x 15% growth x 19.1 = 5,346). First forward scenario: Let's start with a bullish assessment:GDP remains at roughly 2% and international markets are stable. In that case, even if earnings expectations drop to 10% from 15%, the forward multiple is unlikely to slip into recession territory. So let's assume 10% earnings growth for 2025 and because the economy is still growing, let's keep the multiple at 19.That would get you to 5,089 on the S & P 500 ($243.53x 10% growth x 19 = 5,089). Second scenario: Let's assume 10% earnings growth for 2025 and let's say a lower, more historically normal multiple of 17. That would get you to 4,554 on the S & P 500 ($243.53x 10% growth x 17 = 4,554). 4,554 would be about 15% lower than where we are now and would leave the S & P 500 negative on the year (the S & P closed 2024 at 4,769). Third scenario: Bearish. If GDP went to zero or below, the numbers can get much worse. In that case let's assume earnings go to up 5% instead of 15% and the multiple will go to 15, and you get to 3,835 on the S & P 500 ($243.53 x 5% growth x 15 = 3,835). The only reason I am keep earnings up 5% rather than flat or negative is that even in a recession it is reasonable to assume tech earnings will keep growing. So here is a range of estimates(using 2025 earnings ests.): Current situation: 15% earnings growth, 19.1 P/E = S & P 5,300 Lower growth, same P/E 10% earnings growth, 19 P/E = S & P 5,089 Lower growth, lower P/E:10% earnings growth17 P/E = S & P 4,554 Bearish: 5% earnings growth 15 P/E = S & P 3,835 Recession, really? Remember 2022 All of this begs the question, are we over-reacting a bit?There's a big difference between a growth slowdown and a recession. The jobs numbers were 4.3% unemployment and 114,000 jobs added.That is nowhere near recessionary. \"114,000 jobs really is not that bad in the grand scheme of things,\" Cameron Dawson from NewEdge Wealth said on our air Friday. \"It depends on what you think the neutral level of jobs should be. If it's 150,00, 114,000 is not bad. If you think it should be closer to 200,000-300,000 then that 114,000 is pretty bad.\" Keith Lerner at Truist Wealth noted that average job growth in recent years has been around 170,000, not far off from the July print and close to the pre-pendemic level. The fact that there has been such an enormous move in stocks and particularly Treasury yields in the last week is a sign the market has been a bit offsides on the growth story. But it's not a sign of recession. Remember 2022:Everyone was convinced of an imminent recession.Everyone was wrong."

        "content": "The stock market is facing several issues: a tech re-rating, a slower economy, a seasonally weak period and an uncertain presidential outcome. Big-cap tech is getting re-rated This is what happens when the market gets top-heavy in technology. Like the pros say, when you get a correction in a concentrated market, you take the stairs up and the elevator down. Prices for megacap tech stocks have run up dramatically in hopes of outsized earnings. The problem  as was demonstrated by the reaction to Alphabet's earnings yesterday  is that investors are coming to understand there is still not a big payoff for the artificial intelligence infrastructure play, that the return on investment, or ROI, on AI is not going to materialize for a long time. Tech overlords do not seem very worried about this.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaisaid he'd rather overspend on capex than misread demand and underspend. Investors may not share the same sentiment. Regardless, investors have been re-rating tech stocks for many weeks now.I noted several weeks ago that investors were concerned that, while earnings for the biggest tech stocks were continuing to rise, they were not going up as fast as they had been.Decelerating earnings growth is a classic warning sign. This did not happen overnight.Technology stocks have been toppy for some time. Many of the major tech indexes and exchange-traded funds are down double digits from recent highs. Technology sector ETFs (% off 52-week highs) Ark Innovation (ARKK): 18% Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU):17% VanEck Semiconductor (SMH): 15% S & P Technology Sector (XLK): 9% Vanguard Mega Cap Growth (MGK): 8% Global X Social Media (SOCL): 9% Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ): 8% Semiconductors, which were the market leaders in the first quarter, have been particularly weak. Semiconductors (% from 52-week high, and when they hit highs) AMD : 36% (March) Micron : 30% (June) Qualcomm : 21% (June) Nvidia : 19% (June) Broadcom : 18% (June) Weak economy also an issue Second, there are concerns about a slowing economy and that the Fed may stay high too long. Former New York Federal Reserve Bank President Bill Dudley's editorial Wednesday was the catalyst for this worrywart crowd. Dudley suddenly announced that, \"The facts have changed, so I've changed my mind\" about the economy and called for the Fed to cut rates next week because the three-month average unemployment rate was rising. Don't forget seasonality Seasonality is also a factor, as volatility tends to increase mid-July to October. Goldman Sachs noted that the historic inflection date, the date when the S & P 500 starts seeing more down days, is July 17, with a peak in September, but not really flipping until the end of October. \"No more neon green days in the upcoming summer future,\" Goldman said in the report. Watch ETF flows  they have been exceptionally strong One of the things that has really helped the markets this year is consistently strong inflows into equity ETFs, particularly plain-vanilla index ETFs such as the S & P 500. Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street, noted $500 billion in inflows into ETFs so far this year, on pace for a record year. ETFs already have about $10 trillion in assets under management. Watch the flows here for signs of weakness.It is very typical for flows to dry up in August as everyone is away for vacation. Does the election matter? Historically, most presidents do not have a big effect on the stock market. However, this election may be different. Curiously, \"S & P500 has been super correlated to Trump Win odds lately,\" Goldman wrote in the same report, noting that the recent change in election probabilities  with Kamala Harris now the likely Democratic nominee  may be causing some \"recalibration\" in portfolios. CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall seems to agree. \"The 'certainty' of the Trump trade appears to be fading,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\"In the near term, investors may end up being frozen by indecision until clarity improves on a multitude of issues, such as industry regulation, medical insurance, corporate and individual tax policy, and defense spending, just to name a few.\" It is an interesting observation, and just one more ingredient in this very tricky summer stew."

        "content": "While we are getting a tech rally Wednesday thanks to Advanced Micro Devices (up 7%), this is the month when rotation became more than a one-day event. We are going into the last day of the month with the S & P 500 little changed in July, but everything else further down the market capitalization scale is having a fine summer: Major indexes in July S & P 500: +0.7% S & P 500 Equal Weight +4.8% Russell 2000 +10% S & P Midcap +5.5% Within the S & P 500, the dispersion among sectors is unusually large, with technology lagging and everything from defensive to cyclicals to commodities all higher. S & P 500 sectors in July Banks +16.1% Real estate + 6.9% Utilities + 6.1% Industrials + 4.8% Materials + 4.2% Health care + 2.6% Consumer staples + 2.0% Energy + 2.0% Technology - 3.3% Communication services - 4.6% Semiconductor ETF (SMH) - 7.0% When you have sectors such as banks, energy, health care and consumer staples up, that usually would signal a strong month for value, and that is indeed what has happened: Growth vs. Value in July S & P 500 Value + 4.8% S & P 500 Growth - 2.3% Why is this happening?Since small-cap companies often have more debt and higher borrowing costs, the expectation of lower rates is certainly a factor. But valuation plays a part as well. Large-cap stocks, particularly tech, have grown their valuations much faster.I noted weeks ago that more fundamentally inclined investors were worried about the slower rate of earnings growth for big-cap technology stocks . The Russell 2000 would also benefit any time a rotation out of tech occurs because the weightings are different.While the two sectors that comprise technology in the S & P 500  technology and communication services  are about 40% of the S & P 500, the Russell 2000 is much more diverse. Russell 2000:Sector weightings Industrials 18.8% Health care 15.0% Financials 15.0% Technology 14.0% Consumer discretionary 12.7% Energy 7.8% Real estate 5.8% Other 11.0% Source: FTSE/Russell That means when a true rotation occurs in an environment where rates are expected to decline, small caps can be a beneficiary."

        "content": "This week will mark the biggest week for initial public offerings all year. Unfortunately, it may not be enough to get the IPO market out of its funk. Financial services firm OneStream priced its IPO on Tuesday night at $20, above the price talk of $17 to $19. Its shares opened Wednesday at $26. That's the good news. The bad news: The pricing valued the company at about $4.6 billion, but the last private funding round in 2021 valued the company at $6 billion, so the company is going public at a roughly 25% haircut to its last private funding round. This is now a familiar story. Many companies raised money two to four years ago in private funding rounds at very high valuations. Many of these companies are now trying to go public, and investors are balking at the high valuations and demanding haircuts. Biggest IPO of the year set to price tonight Meanwhile, investors are waiting for a massive deal to price Wednesday night. The stock will begin trading on Thursday under the symbol \"LINE\" on Nasdaq. Lineage, the largest temperature-controlled warehouse real estate investment trust in the world, expects to price 47 million shares at between $70 and $82. The company stores fresh food and other perishables in its warehouses, and hopes to raise $3.6 billion. This would be far and away the largest IPO of the year at more than twice the size of cruise operator Viking Holdings , which went public in May. Another tough year No matter how you slice it, 2024 is turning out to be the third consecutive year of subpar IPO markets. Only $17.8 billion has been raised so far this year, according to Renaissance Capital. The average going back a decade is about $50 billion for the full year. IPOs: Total raised 2024 YTD: $17.8 billion 2023: $19.4 billion 2022: $7.7 billion 2021: $142 billion (record) 2020: $78 billion 2019: $46 billion 2018: $47 billion Source: Renaissance Capital It's a valuation problem The issue is not the markets, which despite the recent downdraft, are just short of record highs. Interest rates have also been more stable. The problem is valuations. \"Public investors are not willing to pay 2021 valuations,\" Matt Kennedy from Renaissance Capital said. \"All of the companies that had funding rounds [in the last few years] are aware of this. The question is, how much demand is there in the public market for these deals? The answer is, there is some demand. Companies that want an up-round are going to be disappointed, but companies willing to take a haircut can get deals done.\" The upshot: It depends. Many companies are looking at the pressure of a lower valuation to go public and are likely saying, \"We have enough cash and enough funding, let's wait until 2025.\" Others may be willing to accept the lower valuations  or may not have the choice because they need the additional cash because private funding is no longer available. On the bright side It has been a depressing trend over the past few years. IPOs see a one-day pop, and then trade down over the next few weeks and months. The poor investors who bought on the first day end up losing money. Maybe getting companies to go public at prices lower than their last private funding round will be good for buyers of IPOs, as maybe more companies will see their stock prices hold up after their debuts."

        "header": "Spot ether ETFs are set to trade Tuesday. Here\u2019s what it means for the Ethereum blockchain",
        "content": "Spot ether exchange traded funds are set to  begin trading on Tuesday . Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful it will broaden the investor base for Ethereum, a blockchain technology many argue has a far wider use case than bitcoin. These ETFs will invest directly in ether, whichis the cryptocurrency used in the Ethereum network. There are already ether ETFs that track futures contracts, but these are the first to track spot ether. Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE)  Bitwise Ethereum (ETHW) VanEck Ethereum (ETHV) 21Shares Core Ethereum (CETH) Invesco Galaxy Ethereum(QETH) Fidelity Ethereum (FETH)  Franklin Ethereum (EZET) iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) Like the spot bitcoin ETFs that  launched in January , most are waiving fees initially  in many cases for up to a year. By the standards of ETF launches, spot bitcoin ETFs have been a success: They recently topped  $17 billion in net flows  year to date since their debut. For a new asset class, that is a big hit. However, at $1.3 trillion in total assets, bitcoin has about three times the value of ether, which has about $414 billion in assets. That may limit the initial appeal of ether ETFs. Bitcoin prices rose going into the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs.Ether has been a bit spottier: It is up 50% in 2024, but most of the gain came in the first three months of the year. Still, for Ethereum enthusiasts, the primary value of a spot ether ETF is that it's a perfect vehicle to educate the public about the use cases for Ethereum, which are far greater than anything bitcoin has to offer. Ben Johnson, Morningstar's head of client solutions and an ETF research veteran, noted that while bitcoin is often advertised as digital gold, \"Ethereum is more like picks and shovels.\"  \"The case for the former is that it is finite and could be a store of value, the latter is not finite and being used to build some real-world applications,\" he said. Many investors have never been impressed with bitcoin, primarily because the use case seems limited: It is purely a digital currency.But the Ethereum platform is different. Bitcoin and Ethereum both utilize blockchain, which is a decentralized, immutable ledger to record transaction histories, but they have very different purposes. Bitcoin uses the blockchain as a digital currency. Ethereum utilizes digital money just like bitcoin, but its blockchain has broader purposes. (Ether is the cryptocurrency used in the Ethereum network, but in practice the terms Ethereum and ether are often used interchangeably.) Ethereum is a platform for building smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that enforce a pre-existing contract or agreement.It can be as simple as \"If I do this, you do that.\" The key is that they execute automatically, are done on the blockchain (the Ethereum network) and produce the same result each time they are executed. They also have a wide variety of applications. The most common use is for decentralized finance, or \"DeFi.\" This is just a fancy term for using financial services on the blockchain.In theory, you could perform almost any banking services:Users can send, lend or borrow money, open a savings account, trade stocks or derivatives or other cryptocurrencies, get insurance.Theoretically, you could also do real estate transactions. Users can perform these functions using software called \"decentralized apps.\" The use case goes beyond financial services. Users can play games. Corporations could use it for tracking supply chains. It could even be used as a clearing platform to settle stock trades. Another application for Ethereum:stablecoins. These are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to another asset, usually the dollar.Because cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether are volatile, many DeFi applications rely on stablecoins for lending, borrowing and trading. The promise is a transaction network that  in theory  could be a much cheaper and faster way to do business. It's not clear whether this latest development will open the floodgates for more crypto ETFs  or whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will find a way to stop the potential tidal wave. Any applicant for other crypto ETFs would still need to show that the underlying market was not subject to manipulation, a crucial requirement for approval of these funds. But a lot may depend on the political climate. In the past, for commodities, the SEC has traditionally required a regulated futures market to trade alongside the asset.Right now, that only exists for bitcoin and ether, so it would take time to develop futures markets for other crypto products. \"Under the current regime in Washington, that would not change,\" Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise told me. \"But if you get a change of regimes in Washington, that could change.\" Regardless, expect a lot of trading. \"These new ETH ETFs will likely trade a lot,\" Johnson at Morningstar told me.\"I'd guess that if and when options on these ETFs become available, this will all go into overdrive.... These ETFs effectively add a whole new wing to the crypto casino.\" For the moment, selling Ethereum as a new transaction platform is the main game, and Ethereum enthusiasts have a potent argument:that the platform is a technology investment at heart. \"A lot of investors view bitcoin as digital gold, a store of value, whereas investors view Ethereum more as a technology play,\" Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, said on CNBC TV last night. Note: Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck; Morningstar's Ben Johnson; and David Mann, ETF product and capital markets at Franklin Templeton, will be on ETF Edge Tuesday, July 23 at 1:10 p.m., Eastern.

        "content": "A week ago, investors were scoffing at the idea that small caps and value stocks might have a genuine summer rally. This has been tried before in the last few years, and it has always ended in tears. One week later, and the trend clearly has some legs. Money has been moving mostly out of tech for more than a week and into small-cap and value stocks, which are often industrials, materials and some financials. The S & P 500 Value ETF (IVE) , which holds stocks like Berkshire Hathaway , JP Morgan , Exxon Mobil and Johnson & Johnson , finally hit a new high after lagging the tech-dominated S & P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) for more than a year. \"The BIG question is whether this is truly rotational or just a trade on interest rates (rate cuts = small cap rally is out there as a narrative in multiple venues),\" ETF journalist and financial futurist Dave Nadig told me.\"If it works for more than a few days, I suspect the ['fear of missing out' crowd] will start heaving money into products like the Avantis Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV).\" The rather sudden move into small caps and value has already led to outsized moves in a number of exchange-traded funds. Small-cap and value ETFs in July SPDR Portfolio S & P 600 Small Cap ETF (SPSM) + 9% SPDR Portfolio S & P 400 Mid Cap ETF (SPMD) + 7% SPDR Portfolio S & P 500 Value ETF (SPYV) + 4% With the S & P up 3.8% this month, these are not blowout moves but outperformance from these sectors has been so rare it is enough to attract momentum traders. But these are the most obvious moves.Unsurprisingly, some investors are seeking to capitalize on the moves in novel ways. How to play this rotation in a single ETF The game is how to play the market, ex-mega caps, in a single investment. One example:the Vanguard Extended Market ETF (VXF).This fund holds the entire stock market, minus the S & P 500. Sounds weird, right?But it might be the perfect ETF for this market.It takes the S & P Total Market Index, which is the entire investable equity universe in the United States (we are talking over 3,000 stocks), and takes out the S & P 500. The resulting portfolio consists of everything from mid-caps to micro-caps and, with an expense ratio of just six basis points (0.06%), is among the cheaper ETFs to play such broad exposure. It's up about 8% in the last week, to a two-and-a-half-year high. VXF 1M mountain Vanguard Extended Market ETF over the past month. Other little-noticed corners of the market that make similar but not identical calls include the iShares Russell 2500 ETF (SMMD), which tracks the Russell 2000 plus 500 more stocks that go into the micro-cap space, also up 8% in the last week. Or take the Hilton Small-MidCap Opportunity ETF (SMCO), an actively managed value fund that makes more concentrated bets in the small-cap space (the top 10 stocks are 25% of the fund), up about 6% in the last week. This trend of buying small caps and value is clearly more than a one-day wonder: It's now a one-week wonder. There's an old saying among the flow traders thatflows aren't necessarily a signal, meaning you have to be careful extrapolating short-term movements, particularly in ETFs. Still, what we have seen so far is already attracting the momentum people. Next step: Let's see if it lasts through the summer."

        "header": "BlackRock's ETF business just keeps growing, but the search for revenue goes on",
        "content": "When  BlackRock  CEO Larry Fink bought the iShares ETF business from Barclays for roughly $13 billion in 2009, the economy was still reeling from the great financial crisis. At the time, $13 billion seemed like an awful lot of money to spend on a tiny business. ETFs were still in their infancy: there was roughly $700 billion in total assets under management, a paltry sum compared to the trillions then in mutual funds. By these metrics, Fink's gamble has proven to be one of the greatest financial investments of all time. Doing a sum-of-the-parts analysis of Blackrock's ETF business would be a difficult endeavor, but certainly revenue, assets under management (AUM), and growth potential are important factors. According to Greggory Warren, equity strategist at Morningstar, Blackrock total revenue was $17.8 billion in 2023. Of that, iShares equity ETF pulled in $4.41 billion and iShares fixed income tallied $1.23 billion (They don't break down alternative ETFs and multiasset class, but they are both relatively small.) So the iShares ETF revenue was about a third of Blackrock's revenue, and Warren said that segment is still growing. Revenue growth: Check. Assets under management for Blackrock's ETF business was $3.85 billion, a number that has roughly doubled from the $1.79 trillion of ETF AUM announced five years earlier in November 2018. It appears this figure includes ETFs that listed and traded outside the United States, including London and Canada, but even excluding ETFs outside the U.S., Blackrock still has the dominant position in total AUM. ETFs: Where the money is Blackrock: $2.9 trillion Vanguard: $2.7 trillion State Street: $1.3 trillion Invesco: $570 billion Schwab: $360 billion  Remainder: approximately $1.5 billion Source: ETF Action AUM growth: Check. As for growth potential, inflows were $83 billion in the second quarter, or $150 billion year-to-date. To give you an idea of how large that is, it's about one-third of the inflows into the entire ETF business. Inflow growth: check. By any metric, Blackrock's ETF business just keeps getting more valuable. Revenue: growing. AUM: growing. Inflows: growing. Blackrock's ETF business is a gold mine, but total AUM for the entire ETF business now a bit over $9 trillion, which means Blackrock and a few rivals control a staggering amount of ETF investment dollars. If you look at the list above, it's clear the rich are getting richer. There's about 300 ETF providers, but the top five represent about 85% of all the ETF assets. The ETF business is still raking in money, but there is tremendous fee pressure across the entire ETF universe, so the search for more revenue goes on. Neither Fink at Blackrock nor anyone else in the asset management business can afford to rest on their AUM. For example, Blackrock recently announced their  LifePath Paycheck program , an attempt to muscle into a difficult area: the annuities business. Investors have historically been deeply suspicious of annuities due to low payouts and high commissions. LifePath Paycheck uses Blackrock's existing target date fund framework, which automatically adjusts asset allocation as participants approach retirement (less equities, more bonds). Here's the kicker: starting at age 55, a participant can allocate a portion of their assets to a lifetime-income asset class. Participants can begin redeeming their investment at 59 and purchase annuities from insurers selected by BlackRock. Another area of potential growth is private equity. Blackrock recently  purchased Preqin , a leading provider of alternative equity data, for approximately $3.2 billion in cash. What they want is more access to private equity data. With the IPO market still range-bound, there's big money to be made in private equity. There's the potential to create indexes for private equity investment. But the investment is bigger than just data. The big hope  that somehow an ETF of private equity investments could be created  remains, for the moment, a pipe dream, for the simple reason that buying the underlying private equity assets and managing them in an ETF wrapper is exceedingly difficult. (To create and redeem ETF shares, the market makers would have to be allowed to buy and sell the underlying assets, difficult, if not impossible, to do on a daily basis when you are dealing with private equity.) Might it be possible to create an index and then find a way to synthetically mimic the index without owning any underlying private equity? That is a possibility. Regardless of the challenges, remember that this is a scale business. You could take in billions of dollars more, and because it is so technologically advanced, the costs are minimal. And that is what keeps a smile on Fink's face. \"We have $2 trillion more in assets than we did a year ago with the same amount of employees. That is technology at work,\"  Fink said  on CNBC's  \"Squawk on the Street\"  Monday morning. Correction: An earlier version misstated the amount of assets under management in ETFs in 2009."

        "header": "Upcoming earnings will determine whether the stock market rotation is here to stay or a one-day wonder",
        "content": "You can call Thursday the \"revenge of the diversified portfolio.\"With advancing stocks beating declining ones 6-1 on the New York Stock Exchange, it wasn't so much a negative on tech stocks day as it was a positive on diversification day, with strong rallies in cyclicals, interest rate sensitive and banks. Here's the one issue that matters:Was it more than a one-day wonder? Certainly lower interest rates are a huge help, particularly for small-cap companies that are generally more sensitive to interest rate changes. Confidence that the economy is slowing but still strong is also key to the belief that the Federal Reserve will cut rates beginning in September. But none of this matters without earnings.There must be a belief that earnings will broaden out beyond a small group of megacap tech stocks. The root source of the long tech rally is the superior earnings growth of technology.Two questions follow:With the massive rise in tech prices, is most or all of that earnings growth now priced in, and what are the prospects for earnings growth in other sectors? With earnings, it's not just whether earnings are going up or down, it's how much they are going up or down.What is the rate of change? In the case of megacap tech stocks, I pointed out two weeks ago that while earnings for megacap tech are continuing to grow, the rate of change in earnings growth is slowing , particularly in market leaders such as Nvidia. This is a warning sign for investors who continue to throw money at megacap tech. Earnings growth beyond tech Strategists are already getting out ahead of this. \"Expectations are for the rest of the market to close the gap with megacap tech. That means that earnings are broadening out,\" Supriya Menon, EMEA head of multi-asset strategy at Wellington Management, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \"When we look ahead, we see big-cap tech moderating in terms of the earnings they can deliver in the coming quarters.\" Bank of America's Savita Subramanian is also in the \"broadening out\" camp. \"2Q is expected to be the first EPS growth quarter for the Other 493 since 4Q22, whereas growth for the Mag 7 is expected to slow for the second straight quarter and again in 3Q. Growth is broadening out and so should the market,\" Subramanian said. It's great to be optimistic about earnings broadening out.The problem is identifying where this additional earnings growth is coming from, and how robust it might be. Consumer stocks have not seen much growth at all. In a recent note, BofA's consumer analyst Bryan Spillane said, \"Demand remains stubbornly weak broadly across our consumer staples coverage universe.\" Outside of weight loss drugs, neither has health care.Large-cap banks have been doing better, but regionals are lagging due to deposit flight, poor loan growth and exposure to commercial real estate. If revenues drive earnings, it's hard to be exuberant.Even Subramanian admits, \"Excluding the Mag 7, consensus expects just +1% in real sales growth in 2H,\" she noted. Put all this together and BofA's global sales advisory desk, in a note yesterday, concluded \"it hasn't really paid to be experimental, yet.\""

        "content": "The third quarter starts Monday with corporate earnings trends largely intact but showing early signs of trouble in tech land. The S & P 500 will end the second quarter up about 4%.The good news:For the big-cap tech companies that are truly dominating the market ( Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Nvidia , etc.), earnings trends are continuing to rise. The bad news:For those same dominant tech companies, the rate of change of the earnings is slowing down, and that may mean trouble for investors still piling into Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet. Rate of change is critical Stocks are securities that offer ownership in the company and a claim on the company's assets and future earnings.Following the trend of earnings (up or down?) is therefore the most widely followed game on Wall Street, and it is not just whether earnings are rising  it's whether growth rates are accelerating or decelerating. If earnings for XYZ stock were rising 5% in 2022, then rising 10% in 2023 and are expected to rise 15% in 2023, that is good because:1) earnings are going up, and 2) the rate of change of the earnings is increasing. That is what you are looking for. Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia have earnings estimates that are still going up in 2024, but the rate of change is slowing.That's not surprising.No one sees their earnings or cash flow rate of change increase every year into infinity. Take Nvidia.A little over a year ago, analysts caught on to the artificial intelligence story and started dramatically raising future earnings estimates for Jensen Huang's company.Look at the rate of change in Nvidia's reported earnings during this time: Nvidia: reported earnings (with rate of change from prior quarter) July 2023: $0.27 +145% October 2023: $0.40 + 50% January 2024: $0.52 + 30% April 2024: $0.61 + 17% July 2024 (est.) $0.64 + 5% You see how the rate of change of the reported earnings went from 145% in July 2023 to just 5% for the upcoming (July 2024) quarter. That is a red flag, and many strategists, all of whom are grounded in fundamental analysis such as earnings trends, have been sounding the alarm on this. \"This tells me that Nvidia is slowly losing its positive earnings revision momentum, even though investors keep bidding up the price,\" Nick Raich from Earnings Scout told me.\"Nvidia's stock is at risk because if it merely maintains guidance, it's not going to be good enough anymore.\" Raich has a ranking system that measures the rate of change of earnings estimates.Nvidia has one of the worst scores, and most of the other major tech stocks have low scores as well. Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, agrees. \"We've got a trade that is generally full in terms of valuations,\" she told CNBC on Thursday.\"There are some things I've learned in my two decades on Wall Street.When you've got expensive valuations and decelerating growth rates from astronomical valuations, there is not a lot of margin for error.\" What about the rest of the market, the other 493 or so stocks in the S & P 500 that are not big-cap tech? \"The other companies have better earnings estimate revision trends, and their prices are cheaper,\" Raich told me.\"They offer more compelling values.\" Cautionary forecasts from early reporters Outside of tech, there are some indications that second-half estimates might be too bullish.Eighteen companies have reported earnings so far, and Nike , Walgreens , Micron , Levi Strauss , FedEx and General Mills were among the companies that gave outlooks that failed to impress Wall Street. Companies such as Southwest Airlines and pool supply distributor Pool Corp. unexpectedly warned of weak results ahead, too. One other warning sign: Consumer-facing companies are already warning about significant pushback on price hikes. That hurt Walgreens' profit margins after it resorted to \"higher promotional activity\" to stimulate sales in a challenging consumer environment. \"The consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing,\"Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC. Promotional activity also weighed on margins for retailers such as Macy's , Lowe's and Urban Outfitters , which all recently reported lower profit margins than a year ago. Nike told analysts that it \"missed our fourth quarter plan on softer traffic, higher promotions [and] lower sales of certain classic footwear franchises.\" This week, McDonald's and Yum Brands' Taco Bell were the latest fast-food players to launch value menus to help lure back more cash-strapped customers. The restaurant business has become increasingly competitive as consumers have sought out more value to combat soaring menu prices. General Mills also cautioned that pricing issues  not volume troubles  will be a headwind in the year ahead. Still no recession, in the economy or in earnings So far, we have a deceleration in big-cap tech earnings and clear signs the consumer wants lower prices. Regardless, this is not leading to a collapse in earnings. Overall earnings trends for the S & P 500 have been steady for months.Estimates for the current quarter and out to the end of the year are almost unchanged from the prior quarter, indicating (again) little expectation of an imminent recession.

One thing's for sure: the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs this year has been a success.How can you tell? Here's how:in the first half of a typical year, most of the inflows into ETFs are in plain vanilla passive index funds, like the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) . That's still true for this year, but two of the top 10 ETF inflows year to date have been into spot bitcoin ETFs: iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) at number four, and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) at number eight. Top 10 ETF inflows YTD Vanguard S & P 500 (VOO) $44.2 billion iShares Core S & P 500 (IVV) $33.2 billion Invesco QQQ (QQQ) $19.3 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) $17.7 billion Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI) $17.5 billion iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG) $9.8 billion SPDR Portfolio S & P 500 (SPLG) $9.7 billion Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) $9.2 billion Blackrock US Equity Factor Rotation (DYNF) $8.9 billion Vanguard Growth (VUG) $7.7 billion Source: ETF Store Second, spot bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $15 billion in total inflows since launching.By any standard, that is a successful launch for a niche product. Grayscale, which had a pre-existing fund that converted to an ETF, saw some outflows, but that was more than offset by significant inflows into other major players like iShares, Fidelity, ARK, and Bitwise: Spot bitcoin ETFs (Assets under management) iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) $18.4 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) $16.3 billion Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) $10.1 billion ARK Invest/21Shares (ARKB) $2.8 billion Bitwise Bitcoin Trust (BITB) $2.3 billion Other $2 billion Total: $51.8 billion Source: ETF Store What can we expect from the spot ether launch?What would be a victory? Would 50% of the inflows of the spot bitcoin ETF be a win?Twenty-five percent? We'll talk about this with Matt Hougan from Bitwise Asset Management, one of the applicants for a spot ether ETF.Matt is our guest today on ETF Edge at 12:35 p.m. on-air and streaming from 1:10 to 1:30 p.m. ET on ETFEdge.cnbc.com . Also joining Matt is Nate Geraci from the ETF Store."

        "header": "Momentum rules the market this summer, but let the buyer beware",
        "content": "The summer of market momentum continues. For passive investors, its the best of times: Theyre seeing new highs on the two major cap-weighted indexes  S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite  with low volatility. It doesnt get much better than that. For active investors, things havent been so great. These active investors want high volatility so they can quickly profit from their wagers.They want  reversion to the mean  trades, where outperforming sectors underperform, and laggards start rallying. Forget it. Thats not happening. Market volatility is near multiyear lows, and breadth (based on the number of advancing stocks versus decliners) has been flat to down for months. Tech  and the largest of these stocks in particular  is the winner this year, and everything else is bringing up the rear. You can see this in the odd dispersion of equal-weight sector exchange-traded funds, which give each stock in the sector an equal value. Equal weight S & P 500 sector ETFs YTD Technology up 14% Energy up 7% Utilities up 7% Financials up 7% Industrials up 4% Communication Services up 1.9% Health Care down 1% Consumer Discretionary down 1% Consumer Staples down 3% Bottom line: With the S & P 500 up 18% this year to a record high, only 102 names (or 20% of the indexs constituents) are actually up 18% or more.Only 58% of the stocks in the S & P 500 are up this year. The year of momentum With tech being the only big play, momentum players are having a field day. In its basic form, momentum is a simple strategy:You hold stocks that are on a winning streak.Many momentum strategies also sell stocks that are in a downtrend. It sounds simple, right? Except theres a problem.Rebalancing is very tricky because mean reversion is a very real phenomenon in the stock market.Mean reversion is the assumption that a stock price will trend toward the average price over a long period of time. How long? Thats the game. No one knows how long a trend can last. This makes rebalancing  that is, changing the weightings  and reconstituting  or switching out stocks  a momentum portfolio very tricky. Of course, there are ETFs for that. The ETF industry long ago picked up on this strategy. One example is the Invesco S & P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO) , which tracks the S & P 500 Momentum Index.That index follows the performance of stocks in the S & P 500 that have a high momentum score. Another is the iShares USA Momentum Factor (MTUM) , which tracks the MSCI USA Momentum SR Variant Index. Both of these funds have been big winners this year. Momentum ETFs in 2024 S & P 500 up 18.1% Invesco S & P Momentum ETF (SPMO) up 39.9% iShares USA Momentum Factor (MTUM) up 28.5% Both ETFs also have concentrated bets. In the case of SPMO, the top 10 holdings account for about 67% of the fund. Invesco S & P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO) (top holdings) Nvidia 13% Apple 9.9% Microsoft 8.7% MetaPlatforms 8.4% Amazon 7.6% Eli Lilly and Co. 5.3% Broadcom 5.6% Berkshire Hathaway 3.3% JPMorgan 2.3% Costco 2.2% Source: Invesco So far, its been a big winner because the top holdings have been consistent winners all year  and even before. Its also attracted big inflows:There were 4.3 million shares outstanding at the start of 2024, now its up to 24 million shares. Why momentum is a risky strategy Let the buyer beware:Everyone looks like a genius holding on to winners in up markets.These funds can outperform in bull markets, but they can easily underperform in down markets. These funds also go through rebalancing.SPMO is reconstituted and rebalanced twice a year, in March and September, while MTUM is rebalanced in May and November. Rebalancing only twice a year can be a very long time in rapidly changing markets.It means the fund may be very slow catching up with changing trends. In a rapidly changing market environment, the [momentum] strategies can be slow to catch-up meaning any hope of outperformance, especially in the short term, is most likely wishful thinking, the website ETF Stream noted in a 2021 article on momentum ETFs."

        "header": "Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more ",
        "content": "How's your 401(k) looking?A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more. Vanguard has released its annual report,  How America Saves 2024 . Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money. The good news:stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past. The bad news:account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low. The takeaway:Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement. Why do we care so much about 401(k) plans?Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these \"defined contribution\" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets. First, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019. But to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to:1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings. On those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it \"a year of progress.\" Plan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans.This is a major improvement:ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to \"opt-in,\" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not.By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to \"opt-out\" if they did not want to participate. The result:enrollment rates have gone up.Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans. Participant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%. A few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors: They prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments.The average plan contribution to equities is 74%.A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages. They don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all.\"Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,\" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds. In 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286. Why such a big difference between the average and the median?Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts. Distribution of account balances Source: Vanguard  A different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement. Investors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488. A median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement. Of course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security.A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account. So let's do some retirement math. A typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%.Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months. Next, Social Security.As of January 2023,  the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689  per month, or about $20,268 per year. Finally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them. According to the Pension Rights Center,  the median annual pension benefit for a private pension  is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits). Here's our yearly retirement budget: It's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country. Even then, it would hardly be a robust retirement. And these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account  like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56%reported receiving income from a pension. And that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement. In 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security.Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially. To have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more. One issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed.Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year($30,000 for those age 50 or older).The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to. However, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributedthe maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is \"free money,\" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution.The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed. Regardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market.Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate."

        "header": "Nvidia is shaking up this big tech ETF. Here\u2019s what it means for investors",
        "content": "The usual rebalancing of the S & P 500 index and the exchange-traded funds around it is a quarterly event occurring Friday. Most of the time this attracts little, if any, attention. This time  thanks to the relentless rise of Nvidia , up nearly 45% this quarter alone  things are different. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia's performance in 2024 Gap between an index and the ETF that tracks it The S & P 500 has 500 large-cap stocks that are weighted by market capitalization. It is rebalanced every quarter to reflect additions, deletions and changes in share count due to buybacks. Some ETFs follow the broad market benchmark and others track the S & P 500 sector indexes, including technology. These sector ETFs also rebalance quarterly. But there is a difference. The S & P 500 indexes are pure indexes.They do not have any limit on the concentration of individual stocks. Nvidia could become 99% of the S & P 500 by market capitalization, and it would be reflected in the index. That is not the case with ETFs.These are investment funds.There are federal rules they must follow, dating back to the 1930s. Under these rules, no stock can be more than 25% of a fund's exposure, and the combined weight of all stocks bigger than 5% cannot exceed 50% of the fund's holdings. Normally, this is not an issue, as almost no companies have this kind of concentration. But things have changed a bit because three companies  Microsoft , Nvidia and Apple  have market capitalizations of about $3 trillion. This trio dominates the S & P 500 technology index. When the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) , the ETF that seeks to track the S & P technology index, was last rebalanced three months ago, the weightings were very different than they are today: SPDR Technology ETF (XLK) (current weighting in index) Microsoft 22.1% Apple 21.9% Nvidia 6.0% Broadcom 5.4% Here is the current weighting of the four largest stocks in the S & P technology index, as of last Friday: S & P Technology Index (weighting in index) Microsoft 22.0% Nvidia 21.8% Apple 20.6% Broadcom 5.1% Source: S & P Dow Jones Indices There is a problem here:The combined weight of the first three names is over 64%. So under the rules, there must be a rebalance. The rules say you have to cap the last security that breaks the 50% barrier.That would be Apple. So the weighting of Apple is going to be reduced to get the combined weighting of any stock above 5% below 50% of the combined weight, and Nvidia is going to increase. The new weightings look like this: SPDR Technology ETF (XLK) (new weighting in index) Microsoft 21.9% Nvidia 21.6% Apple 4.5% Broadcom 4.5% Source:SPDR Americas Combined, the first three stocks have a weighting of 48%.The goal is not to make it exactly 50%, Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research, told me. In this manner, the cumulative weight of stocks that account for at least a 5% share of the fund is kept below the 50% threshold. This can lead to unusual situations. Because of the rules on concentration, it is possible for an ETF that tracks the S & P technology index to diverge slightly from the index it seeks to track.This has not been a major problem in the past, but it could be if concentration gets even greater in the future. It's all a bit confusing figuring out the numbers, but it makes sense when considering that many investors were burned by investment funds in the Great Depression. Regulators sought to limit concentration to protect investors. Still, a move in a company like Nvidia is rare. \"This is an anomaly,\" Bartolini told me.\"We've never had three companies in the same sector with more than $3 trillion in a single sector.This is a byproduct of the concentration.\""

        "header": "Stock splits are back in fashion. Here's why, and which companies could be next",
        "content": "Stock splits, long out of favor, are making a comeback. It  started with Walmart , which announced a 3-for-1 stock split on Jan. 30, with the additional shares being distributed on Feb. 23. And from there, it picked up steam. On Thursday, Williams-Sonoma announced a 2-for-1 split, and on Wednesday, Broadcom announced a 10-for-1 split. Notable stock splits in 2024   (when distributed)  Walmart  3-1 2/23/24  Cooper Companies  4-1 2/16/24  Texas Pacific Land  3-1 3/27/24  Old Dominion Freight Line  2-1 3/27/24  Nvidia  10-1 6/7/24  Amphenol  2-1 6/11/24  Chipotle Mexican Grill  50-1 6/25/24  Broadcom  10-1 7/12/24  Williams-Sonoma  2-1 7/8/24  Cintas  4-1 9/11/24  Sony Group  5-1 10/8/24  Lam Research  10-1 10/3/24 Stock splits are far less common now than 20 or 30 years ago. During the tech and internet bubble of the late 1990s, stock splits were common. David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, noted that roughly 15% of Russell 1000 firms split their stock each year in the late 1990s, but that proved to be an anomaly. By the mid-2000s, roughly 5% of the Russell 1000 members split their stock each year, and after the great financial crisis from 2008-2009, stock splits practically ceased. Importantly, splits did not increase after the market began recovering in 2010. The likely reason is the institutional base for stock ownership has come to dominate the market. Institutional investors invest by dollar value, not by shares. They would typically buy, for example, $10 million in stock and wouldn't care what the price is. But recently, there are signs of a subtle shift. Some of it may be because the price of some stocks reached absurd levels. Chipotle, for example, has never split its stock and is trading over $3,200 and will soon split 50-for-1. Nvidia was over $1,200 by the time it split 10-for-1. More importantly, some companies appear to be more interested in appealing to retail investors. Nvidia noted that the  purpose of the split  was to \"make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors.\" Chipotle said the same thing. Walmart also cited these factors  in its statement  announcing the split: \"The stock split is part of Walmart's ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels and its desire for its associates to feel that purchasing shares is easily within reach. In theory, no. The value of the company remains the same. However, many academic studies have noted various changes in trading patterns for stocks that split, though these changes are not uniform. One  academic study  published in the Journal of Risk and Financial Management in 2023 found several positive benefits: 1) trading volumes go up 2) liquidity, or the ability to trade a lot of shares without moving the price, improves 3) stock splits increase the shareholder base for the company These changes may have subtle impacts on the stock price. If companies with a retail focus are suddenly more sensitive to their prices, there are some obvious candidates. The \"over $1,000\" club in the S&P 500 is small and getting smaller: Chipotle ($3,230), Broadcom ($1,679) and Lam Research ($1,032) are all splitting their stocks. The holdouts include Booking Holdings ($3,852), Autozone ($2,809), and Deckers Outdoors ($1,026). Other high-priced stocks with a retail focus include Costco ($843) and Super Micro Computer ($872), which recently joined the S&P 500. However, if corporate America smells that there is a trend and can attract attention by splitting stocks, retail-facing companies with much lower price profiles may also become candidates. That might include Spotify ($305), Ulta Beauty ($397) or even ServiceNow ($715), which has never split its stock."

        "content": "The U.S. economy added far more jobs than expected in September, pointing to a vital employment picture as the unemployment rate edged lower, the Labor Department reported Friday. Nonfarm payrolls surged by 254,000 for the month, up from a revised 159,000 in August and better than the 150,000 Dow Jones consensus forecast. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down 0.1 percentage point. With upward revisions from previous months, the report eases concerns about the state of the labor market and likely locks in the Federal Reserve to a more gradual pace of interest rate reductions. August's total was revised up by 17,000 while July saw a much larger addition of 55,000, taking the monthly growth up to 144,000. Strength in job creation spilled over to wages, as average hourly earnings increased 0.4% on the month and were up 4% from a year ago. Both figures were ahead of respective estimates for gains of 0.3% and 3.8%. The average work week nudged lower to 34.2 hours, down 0.1 hour. \"It was 'wow' across the board, much stronger than expected,\" Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, said of the report. \"The bottom line is it was a very good report. You get upward revisions and it tells you the job market continues to be healthy, and that means the  economy is healthy.\" Stock market futures added to gains following the report while Treasury yields moved sharply higher. Restaurants and bars led job creation for the month, with the hospitality industry adding 69,000 positions in September after averaging just 14,000 over the previous 12 months. Health care, a consistent leader in job growth, contributed 45,000, while government grew by 31,000. Other gainers included social assistance (27,000) and construction (25,000). A more encompassing measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons dropped to 7.7%. The share of the workforce either working or looking for work, known as the labor force participation rate, held steady at 62.7%.  The survey of household employment, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed an even stronger picture, with a gain of 430,000 as the employment-to-population ratio increasing to 60.2%, an increase of 0.2 percentage point. Job creation tilted strongly to full-time positions, which were up 414,000, while those reporting part-time work fell by 95,000. Futures market pricing shifted sharply after the report, with traders now assigning a strong chance of consecutive quarter percentage point interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in November and December. The report comes with questions over the labor market's strength and how that will impact the Fed's approach to lowering interest rates. Earlier this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the jobs picture as \"solid\" but said it has \"clearly cooled\" over the past year. There have been scant signs of a stepped-up pace of layoffs, as new claims for unemployment benefits have held steady but hiring rates have cooled. Business surveys, including the Fed's own \"Beige Book\" summary of business conditions, indicate that companies are holding head counts fairly steady. Powell and other Fed officials have indicated a willingness to continue lowering interest rates following last month's half percentage point cut in the overnight borrowing level. However, there's considerable debate within the market about how quickly the central bank will move, and Powell said Monday he expects the Fed to move in quarter-point increments at least through the end of the year."

        "header": "Here's everything to expect when the September jobs report is released Friday",
        "content": "September's jobs picture is expected to look a lot like August's  a gradual slowdown in hiring from earlier this year, a modest increase in wages and a labor market that is looking a lot like many policymakers had hoped it would. Nonfarm payrolls are projected to show growth of 150,000, from 142,000 the month before, with a steady unemployment rate of 4.2%, according to the Dow Jones consensus. On the wage side, the forecast is for a 0.3% monthly gain and a 3.8% increase from a year ago  the annual rate being the same as August. Should the numbers come in as expected, they would hit close to a sweet spot allowing the Federal Reserve to continue to  lower interest rates  without a sense of urgency that it could be behind the curve and at risk of causing a recession. \"The jobs market is slowing down and becoming less tight,\" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management. \"The balance of power has shifted back to employers and away from employees, and that certainly will alleviate the wage pressure, which has been a key component of inflation. We've been team soft-landing for a while, and this is exactly what a soft landing looks like.\" Of course, there's always the possibility of a substantial upside or downside surprise to the numbers. Then there are the monthly revisions that have been dramatic at times, causing the Labor Department to overcount hiring  by more than 800,000  for the 12-month period through March 2024, adding uncertainty to jobs market analysis. \"While we're looking at 150,000 jobs added, I would not be surprised if it comes in at 50,000 and I would not be surprised if it comes in at 250,000,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"I don't think people should get too freaked out either way about this number.\" The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the report at 8:30 a.m. While there will still be one more nonfarm payrolls count before the presidential vote next month, the October report is expected to be distorted by the  dock workers' strike  as well as Hurricane Helene  making September the last \"clean\" report before Election Day. Still, markets will in fact be watching the report closely. Specifically, they'll be looking for indications as to whether the Fed will be able to loosen policy and lower interest rates in a gradual manner more in keeping with prior easing cycles, or will have to repeat the  dramatic half percentage point interest rate cut  it implemented in September. At the same meeting where they approved the reduction, policymakers indicated another half percentage point, or 50 basis points, in cuts before the end of 2024 and another full percentage point in 2025. Markets, though, are pricing in a more aggressive schedule. \"A strong number wouldn't really change their position,\" JPMorgan's Kelly said. \"A weak number could tempt them to another 50 basis points.\" However, Kelly said the Fed is more likely to look at the employment picture as a \"mosaic\" rather than just an individual data point. For the past several months, labor market indicators have been trending lower, though far from falling off a cliff. Manufacturing and services sector surveys have pointed to slower hiring, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week characterized the labor market as solid but softening. Excluding a brief slump at the onset of the Covid pandemic, the last time the monthly  hiring rate  was the level seen this summer  3.3% of the labor force in both June and August  was in October 2013 when the unemployment rate was 7.2%, according to Labor Department data. Job openings  also have fallen and pushed the ratio of available positions to unemployed workers down to 1.1 to 1, from 2 to 1 just a couple years ago. However, a kind of stasis has hit a labor market that not that long ago was wrestling with the \"Great Resignation\" as workers confident they could find better deals elsewhere left their jobs en masse. Excluding the pandemic gyrations in 2020, the  quits rate  hasn't been lower than its current 1.9% since December 2014, while the  separations rate , even including Covid, was last lower than the current 3.1% in December 2012. \"Whatever leverage labor had has dissipated or just eased as the economy's normalized,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at tax consultancy RSM. \"So we're going to have a lot less turnover. We're seeing it in our business. We're hearing it from our clients.\" Still, had someone told Brusuelas back during the Covid tumult four years ago that the economy would be adding nearly 150,000 jobs a month now with an unemployment rate in the low 4% range, he said, \"I'd have bought you a steak dinner.\""

Companies added 143,000 jobs for the month, an acceleration from the upwardly revised 103,000 in August and better than the 128,000 consensus forecast from economists polled by Dow Jones. While hiring increased, the rate of pay growth took another step down. The 12-month gain for those staying in their jobs nudged lower to 4.7%, while tumbling to 6.6% for job switchers, down 0.7 percentage point from August. Job gains were fairly widespread, with leisure and hospitality leading at 34,000, followed by construction (26,000), education and health services (24,000), professional and business services (20,000), and other services (17,000). Information services was the lone category posting a loss, down 10,000. Service providers accounted for 101,000 of the total, with goods producers adding the rest. From a size standpoint, all of the growth came from companies with more than 50 employees. Small firms saw a loss, with those employing fewer than 20 workers down by 13,000. The ADP count comes two days ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show growth of 150,000, following August's disappointing showing of 142,000, of which 118,000 came from private sector hiring. While the ADP report serves as a precursor to the official count, the two can differ, sometimes by wide margins. Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely as they contemplate the next move for monetary policy and interest rates. In  a speech Monday , Fed Chair  Jerome Powell  characterized the labor market as \"solid\" while noting that it has \"clearly cooled\" over the past year. The Fed is expected to follow up its  half percentage point rate cut in September  with further reductions in November and December. The main question is whether the central bank will move in the same large increment or pivot back to a more conventional quarter-point move. Futures market pricing currently points to a quarter-point cut in November then a half-point move in December. Powell indicated that consecutive quarter-point moves are the more likely scenario now, though policymakers remain attuned to the data and will adjust accordingly."

        "header": "Port strike could reignite inflation, with larger economic impact dependent on how long it lasts",
        "content": "A strike hitting ports along the East and Gulf coasts could stoke prices for food, autos and a host of other consumer goods but is expected to cause only modest broader impacts  so long as it doesn't drag on for too long. Manufacturers of everything from trucks to toys to artificial Christmas trees face obstacles now that the  International Longshoremen's Association has called a stoppage  at major Eastern container and cargo ports. From a macro perspective, the impact will depend on duration. President  Joe Biden , under powers granted by the Taft-Hartley Act, could step in and order an 80-day cooling off period that would at least temporarily halt the stoppage, though there's little indication he will do so. That will leave hopes in the hands of negotiators for the union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance that the strike won't drag on and cause greater hardship for a U.S. economy heading into the critical holiday shipping season. \"Labor action by port workers along the East and Gulf coast of the United States will provide a modest hit to GDP,\" said RSM's chief economist, Joseph Brusuelas, who put the weekly impact at a bit more than 0.1 percentage point of gross domestic product and $4.3 billion in lost imports and exports. \"Given that the American economy is on a 3% growth path at this time we do not expect the strike to derail the trajectory of the domestic economy or present a risk to an early and unnecessary end to the current economic expansion,\" he added. Indeed, the $29 trillion U.S. economy has dodged multiple land mines and has been in growth mode for the past two years. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is tracking  third-quarter growth of 2.5% , boosted by an acceleration in net exports. A prolonged work stoppage, though, could threaten that. Some of the main industries facing challenges include coal, energy and agricultural products. One rule of thumb is that for each strike day, it takes nearly a week to get ports operating at normal levels. \"The costs of the strike would escalate over time as backlogs of exports and imports grow,\" Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a client note. \"Perishable products like imported fresh fruit might be first to come into short supply. If the strike extends beyond a few days, shortages of certain production inputs could eventually slow production and raise prices for manufactured goods like autos.\" There are potential buffers, though, to the damage a strike could cause. For one, West Coast ports are expected to take on some of the freight business that would normally go to the eastern ports. Also, some companies had been anticipating the stoppage and stockpiled ahead of time. Moreover, pressure on supply chains, exacerbated sharply during the pandemic, has largely eased and is in fact below pre-Covid levels, according to a  New York Fed measure . \"We think fears around the potential economic impacts are overdone,\" wrote Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics. \"Frequent shocks to supply chains in recent years have left producers more attuned to the risks of running low inventories. It is therefore likely that firms will have taken precautionary measures in case of a strike  not least because the possibility has been touted by the ILA for months.\" Saunders added that he thinks there's a strong possibility that the White House could step in to the fray and invoke a cooling-off period, despite the administration's strongly pro-union leanings. \"There is little chance that the administration would risk jeopardizing its recent economic successes less than two months before a tightly-contested election,\" he said. In the meantime, there are a slew of other issues that could complicate things. Snags in the supply chain could exacerbate inflation just as it appears  price pressures have cooled  from their mid-2022 peak that sent the annual rate to its highest level in more than 40 years. The maritime association is proposing raises approaching 50%, another factor that could reignite inflation just as wage pressures also have receded. The union is looking for larger increases plus guarantees against automation. \"This is clearly transitory. They will have some resolution,\" said Christopher Ball, economics professor at Quinnipiac University. \"That being said, in the short run, if it lasts more than a few days, if it lasts more than a week ... that will certainly push up the prices of a lot of those goods and services now. It could cause price spikes in the short run during the strike, and I can easily see that pushing up prices of certain goods a lot.\" Ball expects the main areas to be impacted will be food and vehicles, both of which have exerted either disinflationary or deflationary pressures in recent months. Small businesses near the ports also could feel adverse impacts, he added. \"If it goes a week or two, you're running into businesses that have real shortages and, yeah, they'll absolutely have to raise those prices just to prevent broad shortages of those goods,\" Ball said. That all comes at an inopportune time for the Federal Reserve. The central bank last month  cut its benchmark borrowing rate  by half a percentage point and indicated more trimming is to come as it gains confidence that inflation is easing. However, the strike could complicate decision-making. The October jobs report, which is the last one the Fed will see before its Nov. 6-7 policy meeting, will be influenced both by strike-impacted layoffs as well as those from Hurricane Helene. It coincides with a looming presidential election on Nov. 5, and the economy as a pivotal issue. \"This would just completely complicate everything that the Fed is trying to do because they're not getting a read to what the economy is actually performing,\" Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research, told CNBC's \"Fast Money.\" Fed Chair  Jerome Powell  on Monday said he  expects the central bank to lower rates  by another half percentage point by the end of the year, somewhat slower than markets had been anticipating. Correction: The International Longshoremen's Association has called a stoppage at major Eastern container and cargo ports. An earlier version misstated the name of the organization."

        "content": "Saudi Arabia cut its growth forecasts and raised its budget deficit estimates for the fiscal years 2024 to 2026, looking ahead to a period of higher spending and lower projected oil revenues. Real gross domestic product is now expected to grow 0.8% this year, a dramatic drop from a previous estimate of 4.4%, according to the latest pre-budget report published by the Ministry of Finance on Monday. The GDP growth projection for 2025 has also been cut from a previous estimate of 5.7% to 4.6%; while the outlook for 2026 has been trimmed from 5.1% to 3.5%. \"The FY2025 budget highlights the Kingdom's commitment to accelerate the regulatory and structural reforms, as well as the development of policies,\" the pre-budget report read. \"It also focuses on transformative spending to promote sustainable economic growth, improve social development, and enhance quality of life.\" The latest report further emphasized the Saudi government's plans to deploy sovereign and development funds \"for capital investment while empowering both the private and non-profit sectors to foster growth and prosperity.\" Saudi authorities also expect that the budget will remain in deficit for the next several years, as the kingdom prioritizes spending to achieve the targets of its Vision 2030 plan to modernize and diversify the heavily oil-dependent Saudi economy. The Finance Ministry projected a wider budget shortfall of about 2.9% of GDP for 2024, compared with a previous projection of 1.9% for the year. It predicted deficits of 2.3% and 2.9% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, also wider than previous estimates. Saudi Arabia's  fiscal breakeven oil price   what it needs a barrel of crude to cost in order to balance its government budget  has  increased in recent months and years  and may well rise higher along with spending increases. The IMF's latest forecast released in April put that fiscal breakeven figure at $96.20 for 2024, marking a roughly 19% increase on the year before. The figure is also about 36% higher than the current price of a barrel of Brent crude, which was trading at around $70.70 as of Tuesday afternoon. Oil prices  are expected to remain subdued  at least in the medium-term amid slowing demand and increased supply globally. Saudi Arabia is hosting major international events that will require steep spending  like the World Cup 2034 and Expo 2030  as well as building out multi-trillion dollar megaprojects like Neom, which is backed by the kingdom's mammoth sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. \"Saudi Arabia's GDP dances to the rhythm of oil, and with recent data from the Ministry of Finance, it's clear that as oil gushes, so does the economy,\" Tarik Solomon, chairman emeritus at the American Chamber of Commerce in Saudi Arabia, told CNBC. \"But when the wells slow, so does the growth.\" Saudi Arabia's public debt has grown from around 3% of its GDP in the 2010s to roughly 28% today, according to the International Monetary Fund  a huge jump, but still low by international standards. Public debt in EU countries, for instance, averages 82%. In the U.S. in 2023, that figure was 123%. Its relatively low debt level and high credit rating makes it easier for Saudi Arabia to take on more debt as it needs to. The kingdom has also rolled out a series of reforms to boost and de-risk foreign investment and diversify revenue streams. While the country's economy has contracted for the last consecutive four quarters, non-oil economic activity grew 4.4% in the second quarter year-on-year, up 3.4% in the previous quarter."

        "header": "Powell indicates further, smaller rate cuts, insists the Fed is \u2018not on any preset course\u2019",
        "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the recent half percentage point interest rate cut shouldnt be interpreted as a sign that future moves will be as aggressive, in fact indicating the next moves will be smaller. The central bank chief asserted during a speech in Nashville, Tennessee, that he and his colleagues will seek to balance bringing down inflation with supporting the labor market and let the data guide future moves. Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course, he told the National Association for Business Economics in prepared remarks. The risks are two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. Powell  did indicate that if the economic data remains consistent, there are likely two more rate cuts coming this year but in smaller, quarter percentage point, increments. That stands in contrast with market expectations for more aggressive easing. This is not a committee that feels like its in a hurry to cut rates quickly, he said during a Q&A period following his speech with Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner. If the economy performs as expected, that would mean two more rate cuts this year, a total of 50 [basis points] more. Stocks fell as Powell spoke , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 150 points. Treasury yields moved higher, with the benchmark  10-year Treasury note  most recently yielding close to 3.8%, up nearly 5 basis points on the session. The remarks come less than two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee  approved the half percentage point,  or 50 basis points, reduction in the Feds key overnight borrowing rate. A basis point equals 0.01%. Though markets had been largely expecting the action, it was unusual in that the Fed historically has only moved in such large increments during events such as the Covid pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008. The likelihood of another 50 basis points in cuts would be consistent with estimates provided in the FOMCs dot plot indicating individual officials assessments of where rates are headed. Addressing the decision at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, Powell said it reflected policymakers belief that it was time for  a recalibration of policy  that better reflected current conditions. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed began fighting surging inflation; policymakers of late have shifted their attention to a labor market that Powell characterized as solid though it has clearly cooled over the last year. That decision reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in an environment of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to our objective, Powell said. We do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor market conditions to achieve 2 percent inflation, Powell added. Futures market pricing is indicating that the Fed is more likely to move cautiously at its Nov. 6-7 meeting and approve a quarter-point reduction. However, traders see the December move as a more aggressive half-point cut. For his part, Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool. Inflation during August  was around 2.2% annually, according to the Feds preferred personal consumption expenditures price index released Friday. While that is close to the central banks 2% goal, core inflation, which excludes gas and groceries, was still running at a 2.7% pace. Policymakers usually consider core inflation as a better guide for longer-run trends being that food and energy prices are more volatile than many other items. Perhaps the most stubborn area of inflation has been housing-related costs, which rose another 0.5% in August. However, Powell said he believes the data eventually will catch up with easing prices for rent renewals. Housing services inflation continues to decline, but sluggishly, he said. The growth rate in rents charged to new tenants remains low. As long as that remains the case, housing services inflation will continue to decline. Broader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation."

        "header": "Britain's finance minister calls for spending discipline but no return to austerity",
        "content": "Liverpool, ENGLAND  U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves vowed on Monday that Britain will not return to austerity, but said she would make hard choices as she lays out budget proposals next month. \"It will be a budget with real ambition ... a budget to deliver the change we promised. A budget to rebuild Britain,\" she told a crowd of Labour party delegates Monday. \"There will be no return to austerity.\" Her keynote speech, briefly interrupted by heckles from a pro-Palestinian protester in the crowd, came as Labour kicked off its annual party conference on Monday  its first in power for 15 years. The ruling Labour government has faced criticism for generating an atmosphere of doom over the state of the public finances, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer warning of  \"painful\" decisions  after the party rallied to victory in the July general election. U.K. national debt is currently running at 100% of gross domestic product for the first time since 1961,  fresh data  from the Office for National Statistics showed Friday. In the financial year to August, the deficit totalled 64.1 billion ($85.4 billion)  6.2 billion more than the ONS forecast in March. Reeves has suggested that taxes are likely to rise at her upcoming Oct. 30 Autumn budget after discovering a 22 billion ($29 billion) \"black hole\" in the public finances. Her predecessor Jeremy Hunt, from the rival Conservative Party, has denied the claims as  \"fictitious.\" \"I know that you are impatient for change. But because of that legacy inherited by the Conservatives, the road ahead is steeper and harder than we expected,\" she told the audience Monday. Still, Reeves sought to strike a tone of positivity, saying \"my optimism for Britain burns brighter than ever. My ambition knows no limits.\" Reeves defended a divisive move earlier this month to cut winter fuel allowances for millions of pensioners as the \"right decision in the circumstances we inherited.\" However, she reiterated that the government would not raise income tax, the National Insurance social security payments, value-added tax (a sales levy) and corporation tax. Instead, she vowed to raise additional revenues by eradicating the U.K.'s  non-dom tax concession  and clamping down on forms of tax avoidance and tax evasion. \"This government will not sit back and indulge those who do not pay the taxes they owe,\" she said. The finance minister also restated the government's position as \"proudly pro-business,\" referencing plans next month to host a business summit and announce proposals for a new national industrial strategy. That, she said, would include measures for Britain to reach its net zero and clean energy goals by 2030. Additionally, she said that the government would continue to pursue trade deals to \"open up new markets,\" as negotiations currently remain underway with major partners such as India. \"After years of instability and uncertainty, Britain is open for business once again,\" she said. Failure to act quickly on government spending would \"undermine the U.K.'s fiscal position,\" with implications ranging from public services to mortgages and inflation, Reeves warned, invoking memories of former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss' failed  mini-Budget. \"The Liz Truss experiment showed us that any plan for growth without stability leads to ruin,\" she said, declaring that the \"era of trickle down, trickle out economics is over.\" It comes as public enthusiasm for the government has shown signs of waning, less than three months after the Labour Party secured an historic victory over the Tories. Half of Britons, including a quarter of Labour voters (26%), are disappointed with the government's achievements so far,  Ipsos opinion polling showed Friday . Gideon Skinner, Ipsos' senior director of U.K. politics, said the findings were an indication that the government's \"honeymoon period\" was over. \"There's a seeping back of pessimism and concern following a few months of hope after the election,\" Skinner said earlier Monday at the Labour party conference. Tom Selby, director of public policy at financial services firm AJ Bell, said Reeves' speech was unlikely to have allayed concerns over the fiscal challenges ahead. \"While the chancellor's tone may have been more positive today, she left the conference in no doubt that painful decisions are coming in the Budget on 30 October  although the country remains in the dark on where exactly the axe will fall,\" he said in a note. \"Like nature, politics abhors a vacuum, and the lack of clarity has led to inevitable speculation about possible revenue-raising reforms to pension tax relief and tax-free cash, as well as Capital Gains Tax (CGT),\" he added."

        "content": "Consumers' view on the economy tumbled in September, falling by the largest level in more than three years as fears grew about jobs and business conditions, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. The board's  consumer confidence index  slid to 98.7, down from 105.6 in August, the biggest one-month decline since August 2021. The Dow Jones consensus forecast was for a reading of 104. By contrast, the index had a reading of 132.6 in February 2020, a month before the Covid pandemic hit. Each of the five components the organization samples fared worse on the month, with the biggest fall coming among those aged 35-54 and earning less than $50,000. \"Consumers' assessments of current business conditions turned negative while views of the current labor market situation softened further. Consumers were also more pessimistic about future labor market conditions and less positive about future business conditions and future income,\" said Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board. The last time the confidence index dropped more came as inflation was just beginning a climb to what ultimately was the highest level in more than 40 years. Stocks saw some brief losses following the release, while Treasury yields moved lower. In addition to the steep drop in the confidence index, the present situation measure worsened by 10.3 points to 124.3 and the expectations index was off 4.6 points to 81.7. On the expectations measure, a reading below 80 is consistent with a recession. Respondents' concerns focused mostly on jobs and inflation. Those saying jobs are plentiful continued to decline, falling to 30.9% from 32.7% in August, while the jobs \"hard to get\" measure rose to 18.3%, up from 16.8%. On inflation, the 12-month outlook rose to 5.2%, with concerns over price increases topping the list of economic concerns. \"The proportion of consumers anticipating a recession over the next 12 months remained low but there was a slight uptick in the percentage of consumers believing the economy was already in recession,\" Peterson said. The survey comes less than a week after the Federal Reserve voted to lower benchmark interest rates by a half percentage point, citing a more favorable outlook for inflation and worries over a potentially softening labor market. It was the first rate cut in four years and double the traditional quarter-point reduction. The survey, though, was conducted through Sept. 17, the day before the Fed approved the rate cut."

        "content": "Inflation moved closer to the Federal Reserve's target in August, easing the way for future interest rate cuts, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The  personal consumption expenditures price index , a gauge the Fed focuses on to measure the cost of goods and services in the U.S. economy, rose 0.1% for the month, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.2%, down from 2.5% in July and the lowest since February 2021. The Fed targets inflation at 2% annually. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting all-items PCE to rise 0.1% on the month and 2.3% from a year ago. Excluding food and energy, core PCE rose 0.1% in August and was up 2.7% from a year ago, the 12-month number 0.1 percentage point higher than July. Fed officials tend to focus more on core as a better measure of long-run trends. The respective forecasts were for 0.2% and 2.7% on core. \"All quiet on the inflation front,\" said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. \"Add today's PCE Price Index to the list of economic data landing in a sweet spot. Inflation continues to keep its head down, and while economic growth may be slowing, there's no indication it's falling off a cliff.\" Though the inflation numbers indicated continued progress, the personal spending and income numbers both came in light. Personal income increased 0.2% on the month while spending rose 0.2%. The respective estimates were for increases of 0.4% and 0.3%. Stock market futures were positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative. The readings come a little more than a week after the Fed took down its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by half a percentage point to a target range of 4.75%-5%. The progress in August came despite continued pressure from housing-related costs, which increased 0.5% on the month for the largest move since January. Services prices overall rose 0.2% while goods declined by 0.2%. It was the first time the central bank had eased since March 2020 in the early days of the Covid pandemic and was an unusually large action for a Fed that prefers to move rates in quarter-point increments. In recent days, Fed officials have switched their focus from inflation fighting to an emphasis on supporting a labor market that has shown some signs of softening. At their meeting last week, policymakers indicated a likelihood of another half percentage point in cuts this year then a full point in reductions for 2025, though markets expect a more aggressive path."

        "header": "Ray Dalio says the Fed has a tough balancing act as the economy faces 'enormous amount of debt'",
        "content": "As the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented  its first interest rate  cut since the early Covid-19 pandemic, billionaire investor Ray Dalio flagged that the U.S. economy still faces an \"enormous amount of debt.\" The central bank on Wednesday  cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points  to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The rate not only determines short-term borrowing costs for banks, but also impacts various consumer products like mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. \"The challenge of the Federal Reserve is to keep interest rates high enough that they're good for the creditor, while keeping them not so high that they're problematic for the debtor,\" the founder of Bridgewater Associates told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, noting the difficulty of this \"balancing act.\" The U.S. Treasury Department recently reported that the government has  spent more than $1 trillion this year on interest payments for its $35.3 trillion national debt . This increase in debt service costs also coincided with a significant rise in the U.S. budget deficit in August, which is approaching $2 trillion for the year. On Wednesday, Dalio listed debt, money and the economic cycle as one of the  top five forces  influencing the global economy. Expanding on his point Thursday, he said he was generally interested in \"the enormous amount of debt that is being created by governments and monetized by central banks. Those magnitudes have never existed in my lifetime.\" Governments around the world took on  record debt burdens  during the pandemic to finance stimulus packages and other economic measures to  prevent a collapse . When asked about his outlook and whether he sees a looming credit event, Dalio responded he did not. \"I see a big depreciation in the value of that debt through a combination of artificial low real rates, so you won't be compensated,\" he said. While the economy \"is in relative equilibrium,\" Dalio noted there's an \"enormous\" amount of debt that needs to be rolled over and also sold, new debt created by the government.\" Dalio's concern is that neither former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris will prioritize debt sustainability, meaning these pressures are unlikely to alleviate  regardless of who wins  the upcoming presidential election. \"I think as time goes on, the path will be increasingly toward monetizing that debt, following a path very similar to Japan,\" Dalio posited, pointing to how the Asian nation has kept interest rates artificially low, which had depreciated the  Japanese yen  and lowered the value of  Japanese bonds . \"The value of a Japanese bond has gone down by 90% so that there's a tremendous tax through artificially giving you a lower yield each year,\" he said. For years, Japan's central bank stuck to its negative rates regime as it embarked on one of the most aggressive monetary easing exercises in the world. The country's central bank only recently  lifted interest rates in March  this year. Additionally, when markets do not have enough buyers to take on the supply of debt, there could be a situation where interest rates have to go up or the Fed may have to step in and buy, which Dalio reckons they would. \"I would view [the] intervention of the Fed as a very significant bad event,\" the billionaire said. Debt oversupply also raises questions of how it gets paid. \"If we were in hard money terms, then you would have a credit event. But in fiat monetary terms, you have the purchases of that debt by the central banks, monetizing the debt,\" he said. In that scenario, Dalio expects that the markets would also see all currencies go down as they're all relative. \"So I think you'd see an environment very similar to the 1970's environment, or the 1930 to '45 type of period,\" he said. For his own portfolio, Dalio asserts that he does not like debt assets: \"so if I'm going to take a tilt, it would be underweight in debt assets such as bonds,\" he said."

        "header": "The Fed has set out on a 'recalibration' of policy. Here's what Powell's new buzzword means",
        "content": "Federal Reserve Chair  Jerome Powell  has unveiled his latest buzzword to describe monetary policy, with a \"recalibration\" of policy at a pivotal moment for the central bank. At his  news conference  following Wednesday's open market committee meeting, Powell used variations of the word no fewer than eight times as he sought to explain why the Fed took the unusual step of a half percentage point rate cut absent an obvious economic weakening. \"This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market, and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving forward a more neutral stance,\" Powell said. Financial markets weren't quite sure what to make of the chair's messaging in the meeting's immediate aftermath. However,  asset prices soared Thursday  as investors took Powell at his word that the unusually outsized move wasn't in response to a substantial slowing of the economy. Rather, it was an opportunity to \"recalibrate\" Fed policy away from a rigid focus on inflation to a broader effort to make sure a recent weakening of the labor market didn't get out of hand. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 jumped to new highs  in trading Thursday  after swinging violently Wednesday. \"Policy had been calibrated for meaningfully higher inflation. With the inflation rate now drifting close to target, the Fed can remove some of that aggressive tightening that they put into place,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"It really allows him to push this narrative that this easing cycle is not about us being in recession, it is about extending the economic expansion,\" he added. \"I think it's a really powerful idea. It's something we had been hoping that he would do.\" Several of Powell's previous efforts to provide buzzy descriptions of Fed policy or its views on the economy haven't worked out so well. In 2018, his characterizations of the efforts to reduce its bond holdings  as being on \"autopilot,\"  as well as his assessment that a string of rate hikes the same year had brought the Fed  \"a long way\" from a neutral interest rate  spurred blowback from markets. More famously, his insistence that an  inflation surge in 2021 would prove \"transitory\"  ended up causing the Fed to be slow-footed on policy to the point where it had to enact a series of three-quarter percentage point rate increases to pull down inflation. But markets expressed confidence in Powell's latest assessment, despite this track record and some signs of cracks in the economy. \"In other contexts, a larger move may convey greater concern about growth, but Powell repeatedly stressed this was basically a joyous cut as ebbing inflation allows the Fed to act to preserve a strong labor market,\" Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in a client note. \"Moreover, if policy is set optimally, it should return the economy to a favorable place over time.\" Still Feroli expects the Fed will have to follow up Wednesday's action with a similar-sized move at the Nov. 6-7 meeting unless the labor market reverses a slowing pattern that began in April. There was some good news on the jobs front Thursday, as the Labor Department reported that weekly claims for unemployment benefits slid to 219,000, the lowest since May. The half percentage point  or 50 basis point  cut was remarkable in that it's the first time the Fed has gone beyond its traditional quarter-point moves absent a looming recession or crisis. Though Powell did not give credence to the notion that the move was a makeup call for not cutting at the July meeting, speculation on Wall Street was that the central bank indeed was playing catch-up to some degree. \"This is a matter of maybe he felt like they were getting a little bit behind,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"A 50 basis point cut is pretty unusual. It's been a long time, and I think it was maybe the last labor market report that gave him pause.\" Indeed, Powell has made no secret of his concerns about the labor market, and stated Wednesday that getting in front of a potential weakening was an important motivator behind the recalibration. \"The Fed still sees the economy as healthy and the labor market as solid, but Powell noted that it is time to recalibrate policy,\" wrote Seth Carpenter, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley. \"Powell has stressed and proven with this rate cut that the FOMC is willing to move gradually or make bigger moves depending on the incoming data and evolution of risks.\" Carpenter is among the group that expects the Fed now can dial down its accommodation back to quarter-point increments through the rest of this year and into the first half of 2025. Futures markets traders, though, are pricing in a more aggressive pace that would entail a quarter-point cut in November but back to a half-point move in December, according to the CME Group's  FedWatch  gauge. Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave noted a change in the Fed's post-meeting statement that included a reference to seeking \"maximum employment,\" a mention he took to indicate that the central bank is ready to stay aggressive if the jobs picture continues to deteriorate. That also means the recalibration could get tricky. \"We think the Fed will end up front-loading rate cuts more than it has indicated,\" Bhave said in a note. \"The labor market is likely to remain tepid, and we think markets will push to do another super-sized cut in 4Q.\""

        "header": "Bank of England presses pause on rate cuts, highlights 'gradual approach'",
        "content": "LONDON  The Bank of England on Thursday said it would hold interest rates steady following its initial cut in August, even after the U.S. Federal Reserve opted for a jumbo rate cut the day before. The Monetary Policy Committee voted by 8 to 1 to hold, with the dissenting member voting for another 0.25 percentage point reduction. A \"gradual approach\" to monetary easing remained appropriate, with services inflation staying \"elevated,\" the committee said. The U.K. economy, which has exited a recession but recorded sluggish growth this year, is expected to return to an underlying pace of around 0.3% growth per quarter in the second half, it added. The MPC was assessing a mixed bag of data in making its rate decision, with headline inflation consistently coming in near its 2% target but price rises in services  accounting for around 80% of the U.K. economy   ticking higher to 5.6% in August . Wage growth in the U.K. cooled to a more than two-year low over the three months to July, but remained relatively high at 5.1%. The British pound was bolstered by the BOE and Fed announcements, trading up 0.72% against the U.S. dollar at $1.3306 at 12:10 p.m. London time Thursday. That was the highest rate since March 2022, according to LSEG data. Global equity markets meanwhile rallied Thursday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index 1.45% higher. Also being monitored Thursday was the BOE's annual announcement on the pace of quantitative tightening, or QT. The central bank voted to reduce its stock of U.K. government bonds  known as gilts  by 100 billion ($133 billion) over the next 12 months through active sales and the maturation of bonds. That amount was in line with the prior period, against the expectation of some for an acceleration of the program. The BOE's balance sheet swelled during the pandemic as it sought to boost the economy, before it reversed course and began QT in February 2022. The BOE sustains losses on its QT program, subsidized by the taxpayer, because bonds are being sold for lower prices than they were bought for. However, BOE Governor Andrew Bailey contends the central bank needs to conduct QT now to have space to undertake more quantitative easing or other operations in the future. The BOE confirmed expectations for a hold even after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday  kicked off its own rate cuts in the current cycle  with a 50 basis point reduction. Many strategists had expected a smaller 25 basis point trim at the September meeting, despite market pricing through this week pointing to a more than 50% probability of the aggressive option. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a news conference the central bank was \"trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with this inflation.\" Recent U.S.  labor market data  had sparked concerns about the extent of the slowdown in the world's largest economy. The MPC's decision was likely locked in at about midday Wednesday, ahead of the Fed's announcement, but central bankers around the world will now be assessing what the move means for  global economic growth  and financial conditions. Kyle Chapman, foreign exchange analyst at Ballinger Group, said the BOE delivered a \"more decisive and more hawkish vote than expected\" with the 8 to 1 vote split, supporting gilt yields and lifting sterling. \"This is a cautious decision which reflects the fact that the Bank of England is simply not in as fortunate a position as the Federal Reserve with regards to inflation. ... That said, this meeting reads rather like a lead up to a cut in November, and a continued quarterly pace thereafter.\" The Bank of England  lowered its key rate  to 5% from 5.25% in August in a tight 5 to 4 vote, and was widely expected to hold them there until its next meeting in November. Deutsche Bank's chief U.K. economist, Sanjay Raja, reiterated a call for one more rate cut this year, taking the bank rate to 4.75%, followed by four quarter-point reductions through 2025. \"We see risks skewed to a faster dial down of restrictive policy in the near-term,\" Raja added. Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management, said regarding the QT program that the Bank of England was \"stuck between a rock and a hard place and that's because of the choice they made in the past,\" and that it was the only central bank in the world that was recording these types of losses. The U.K.'s new Labour government is due to deliver its first budget in October. Extending passive and active QT into next year will create \"problems for fiscal policy, at least it doesn't make the government's job easier,\" Ducrozet told CNBC's \" Street Signs Europe \" shortly ahead of the decision. Keeping the rate of QT unchanged, as the BOE opted to do, provided somewhat of a \"middle ground,\" he added."

The former Dallas Fed president told CNBC on Tuesday that making the  bolder move of 50 basis points  would better position policymakers heading into the latter part of the year and the economic challenges ahead. \"If I were sitting at the table, I would be advocating for 50 in this meeting,\" Kaplan said during a \" Squawk Box \" interview. \"I think the Fed may be a meeting or so late, and if I had a do-over, I might prefer we had started the cutting in July, not September.\" Markets currently are putting about 2-to-1 odds that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve a 50 basis point reduction, as opposed to the  25 basis point cut  they had been pricing in leading up to Friday, according to the CME Group's  FedWatch  tool. One basis point equals 0.01%. Fed funds, the central bank's benchmark overnight lending rate, currently stand at 5.25% to 5.50%. Should the committee decide to make the more aggressive move, Kaplan said it would then be incumbent on Chair  Jerome Powell  in his post-meeting news conference on Wednesday to indicate that additional cuts ahead are \"likely to be more measured.\" The Fed's two-day policy meeting gets underway Tuesday. \"From a risk management point of view, 50 makes the most sense,\" Kaplan said. \"If the group is split, a lot of this will depend, actually, on what Jay Powell personally thinks, what is his personal disposition on all this, and then his ability to wrangle everybody to a unanimous decision.\" Kaplan ran the Dallas Fed from 2015-21 and is now vice chairman and member of the management committee at Goldman Sachs."

        "header": "The Fed has the proof it wants that inflation is slowing, but the next move is still up in the air",
        "content": "Federal Reserve officials head into their policy meeting Tuesday closer to their goal of low inflation, but how much they will ease back on interest rates remains an open question. A week's worth of inflation data showed that price pressures have eased substantially since their meteoric rise in 2021-22. One gauge of  consumer prices  showed 12-month inflation at its lowest since February 2021, while  wholesale price measures  indicated pipeline price increases are mostly under control. Both readings were certainly enough to clear the way for an interest rate cut at the  Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which concludes Wednesday with a rate decision and an updated forecast on where central bankers see things heading in the future. \"We got two more months of good inflation data\" since the last Fed meeting, Claudia Sahm, chief economist for New Century Advisors, said in a CNBC interview Friday. \"That's what the Fed asked for.\" The question, though, turns now to how aggressively the Fed should act. Financial markets, which provide a guidepost on where the central bank is heading, were no help. Futures markets for most of the past week had lasered in on a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, rate cut. However, that turned on Friday, with traders switching to an almost even chance of a either a 25- or a half point, or 50-basis point-reduction, according to the CME Group's  FedWatch  tool. Sahm is among those who think the Fed should go bigger. The inflation data \"on its own would have gotten us 25 next week, as it should, and will get us a whole string of cuts after that,\" she said. \"The federal funds rate has been over 5%, has been there for over a year to fight inflation. That fight is won. They need to start getting out of the way.\" That means, Sahm said, starting off with a 50 basis-point reduction as a way to put a floor under potential labor market decay. \"The labor market [since] last July has gotten weaker,\" she said. \"So there's an aspect of just recalibrating. We got some more information. [Fed officials] need to kind of clean it up, do a 50 basis point cut and then be ready to do more.\" The inflation reports indicate that the battle to bring inflation back down to 2% isn't exactly over, but things are at least moving in the right direction. The all-items  consumer price index  nudged up just 0.2% in August, putting the full-year inflation rate at 2.5%. Excluding food and energy, core inflation stood at 3.2%, a good deal farther away from the Fed's target. However, most of the core strength has come from stubbornly high shelter costs, boosted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' byzantine \"owners equivalent rent\" measure that asks homeowners what they could get if they rented out their residence. The yardstick, which comprises about 27% of the total CPI weighting, rose 5.4% from a year ago. Despite lingering pressures, consumer surveys indicate confidence that inflation has been subdued if not completely arrested. Respondents to a University of Michigan survey in September expected inflation to run at 2.7% over the next 12 months, the lowest reading since December 2020. Taking all the various inflation dynamics into account, Fed Chair  Jerome Powell  said in late August that his \"confidence has grown\" that inflation is trending back to 2%. That leaves employment. Powell said in the same speech, delivered at  the Fed's annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming , that the Fed does \"not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.\" The Fed has two jobs  stable prices and a healthy job market  and the primary mission looks about to change. \"If Powell wants to deliver on his, 'we want no further weakening, no further cooling,' they are going to have to, like, really move here, because that cooling trend is well established,\" Sahm said. \"Until it is interrupted, we are going to continue to see payrolls drift down and [the] unemployment rate drift up.\" To be sure, there's considerable sentiment for the Fed to lower by just a quarter-point at next week's meeting, reflecting that the central bank still has more work to do on inflation, and that it is not overly worried about the labor market or a  broader economic cooling . \"That's really the key that they need to kind of hone in on, which is that they are normalizing policy and not trying to provide accommodation for an economy that is really in trouble,\" said Tom Simons, U.S. economist at Jefferies. \"I think they've done a very good job of expressing that point of view so far.\" Even with the quarter-point move, which Simons forecasts, the Fed would have plenty of room to do more later. Indeed, market pricing anticipates rates could come down by 1.25 percentage points by the end of 2024, an indication of some sense of urgency at bringing benchmark borrowing costs down from their highest levels  currently 5.25% to 5.50%  in more than 23 years. \"The whole reason why they've been so cautious about cutting is because they're concerned that inflation is going to come back,\" Simons said. \"Now, they have more confidence based on data that suggested [inflation] isn't coming back right now. But they do need to be very careful to monitor potentially changing dynamics.\""

        "content": "The U.S. government for the first time has spent more than $1 trillion this year on interest payments for its $35.3 trillion national debt, the Treasury Department reported Thursday. With the  Federal Reserve  holding benchmark rates at their highest in 23 years, the government has laid out $1.049 trillion on debt service, up 30% from the same period a year ago and part of a projected $1.158 trillion in payments for the full year. Subtracting the interest the government earns on its investments, net interest payments have totaled $843 billion, higher than any other category except  Social Security  and  Medicare . The jump in debt service costs came as the U.S.  budget deficit  surged in August, edging closer to $2 trillion for the full year. With one month left in the federal government's fiscal year, the August shortfall popped by $380 billion, a dramatic reversal from the $89 billion surplus for the same month a year prior that was due largely to accounting maneuvers involving student debt forgiveness. That took the 2024 deficit to just shy of $1.9 trillion, or a 24% increase from the same point a year ago. The Fed is widely expected to lower rates next week, but just by a quarter percentage point. However, in anticipation of additional moves in future months, Treasury yields have tumbled in recent weeks. The benchmark  10-year note  last yielded about 3.7%, down more than three-quarters of a percentage point since early July."

        "header": "Latinas contributed $1.3 trillion to U.S. economy, new report says. That number could be even bigger",
        "content": "Latinas are making substantial contributions to the U.S. economy. The female Hispanic population contributed $1.3 trillion to gross domestic product in 2021, an increase from $661 billion in 2010, according to a recent  report  funded by Bank of America. That marks a real GDP growth rate of 51.1% between 2010 and 2021, meaning an economic contribution that's 2.7 times that of the non-Hispanic population. The total output of U.S. Latinas in 2021 was also larger than the entire state of Florida that year, the report noted, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, only those from California, Texas and New York, respectively, were larger that year. Despite those large figures, some economists think that U.S. Latinas could be contributing more to GDP than the report's figure. Belinda Romn, an associate economics professor at St. Mary's University, said that there's activity in various areas that the data may not be capturing. Child care is one of those. \"A lot of that is uncompensated care,\" she said in an interview with CNBC. \"Interestingly, there are a lot of Latinas in that space that you're not going to see in these numbers, so I think to some extent it may not be big enough actually.\" Economist Mnica Garca-Prez also believes the figure could be bigger, saying that some of Latinas' \"unmeasured\" contributions  such as being a stay-at-home mom that's providing care for other neighbors' kids, for example  allow \"other groups to participate in the labor market.\" She also pointed to the occupational positions they hold more generally   as posing some difficulty when assessing their contributions. \"This group is very sensitive to shocks, and it could be related to their presence in sectors where there's a lot of mobility or turnover,\" the Fayetteville State University economics professor said. She added that they tend to be concentrated in care and service industries, such as health care, retail and hospitality. This is what makes them a \"moving piece\" in economic cycles. In the case of a recession, for instance, Garca-Prez said Latinas are \"likely to lose their job much faster being in the sectors they're in,\" as seen during the Covid-19 pandemic. \"But they also may be more likely to be reincorporated in the market because the cost of entry and the type of positions they enter at have lower barriers.\" When it comes to labor force participation, Latinas are outpacing other groups, the BofA report showed. From 2000 to 2021, the participation rate for Latinas rose 7.5 percentage points. On the other hand, the participation rate of the non-Hispanic women in the same period was flat. The group has also been more resilient than others. Although labor force growth slowed overall in 2020, the growth rates for Hispanic men and women were still positive. Conversely, the non-Latino labor force growth rate was negative that year, meaning that more people left the labor force than entered it. Beyond that, Latina GDP grew more than five times the rate of non-Latino GDP between 2019 and 2021, gaining 7.7% compared to 1.5%. Meanwhile, the GDP of Hispanic men grew nearly four times the rate of non-Latino GDP in those years at 5.9%. These contributions are notable given that Latino households were  some of the hardest hit  by the pandemic. \"When the economy broadly is most in need, that's actually when we see the most dramatic contributions of U.S. Latinas,\" said economist Matthew Fienup, the report's co-author and executive director of the Center for Economic Research and Forecasting at California Lutheran University. \"Whereas all Latinos are a source of economic strength, Latinas are drivers of vitality that the economy needs.\" \"If Covid-19 couldn't stop this growth, it's hard to see what would,\" said David Hayes-Bautista, report co-author and director of the Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture at the School of Medicine at UCLA. Since the late 1970s, the share of Latinas with a job has grown. Specifically, the employment-to-population ratio for the group has surged from 41.6% in December 1978 to 56% in December 2023, per  data  from the Economic Policy Institute. By comparison, the ratio for Black women  who alongside Latinas experience the  most severe wage gaps  relative to white, non-Hispanic men  has advanced 11.9 percentage points. The metric for women overall has climbed by 8.8 percentage points in that period. \"Some of this is an expansion of opportunities for women,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at EPI. Part of this is also due to a lack of wage growth for typical workers over the past few decades, she said. \"Because it can be hard to get ahead, households may have had to put in more work hours to do better.\" That seems to be paying off to some extent. The growth in labor force participation as well as a  rise in educational attainment  are resulting in income gains for the group, notably about 2.5 times that of non-Hispanic women from 2010 to 2021, the BofA's report co-authors found. Hayes-Bautista also cited intergenerational shifts and Hispanic women's more rapid population growth over the Hispanic male and non-Latino populations as another catalyst of Latinas' economic output. \"What we started to see in about the year 2000 is that the immigrant first-generation started to age out of the labor force,\" he said. \"As they age out, their shoes are being filled by their daughters and granddaughters, who are twice as numerous in terms of population size, and they're bringing much higher levels of human capital.\" Latinas have especially bolstered the contributions of Latinos as a whole. Fienup told CNBC that Latinos' total contributions have pushed labor force growth positive in certain regions across the country at times when the non-Latino labor force was contracting. \"We expect that dynamic to be increasingly important over the next three decades,\" he said. \"What we're seeing now is really just the beginning of what will be an increasingly important story in the United States economy.\""

The  producer price index , a measure of final demand goods and services costs that producers receive, increased 0.2% on the month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. That matched the Dow Jones consensus estimate. Excluding food and energy, PPI increased 0.3%, slightly hotter than the 0.2% consensus estimate. The core increase was the same when excluding trade services. On a 12-month basis, headline PPI rose 1.7%. Excluding food, energy and trade, the annual rate was 3.3%. In other economic news Thursday, the Labor Department said  initial filings for unemployment benefits  totaled 230,000 for the week ended Sept. 7, up 2,000 from the previous period and higher than the 225,000 estimate. Stock market futures  were little changed after the report while Treasury yields were mostly lower. On the PPI measure, services prices pushed much of the gain, with a 0.4% monthly increase driven by a rise in services less trade, transportation and warehousing. Another big contributor was a 4.8% jump in guestroom rental. Goods prices were flat on the month, reversing a 0.6% gain in July. The release comes a day after the BLS reported that  consumer prices rose 0.2%  on the month in line with expectations. However, that report also showed that core prices climbed 0.3%, slightly more than expected and pushed higher mostly by an increase in shelter-related expenses. On an annual basis, headline CPI inflation decreased to 2.5% while core held at 3.2%. Neither report is expected to keep the Fed from lowering benchmark interest rates by a quarter percentage point when its two-day policy meeting concludes Wednesday. The central bank's key overnight borrowing rate is currently targeted in a range between 5.25%-5.5%.  \"With PPI basically repeating yesterday's CPI reading and jobless claims in line with expectations, the decks have been cleared for the Fed to kick off a rate-cutting cycle,\" said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing for E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. \"The markets are anticipating an initial 0.25% cut, but the discussion will soon turn to how far and fast the Fed is likely to trim rates over time.\" Market pricing had indicated some uncertainty over how much the central bank would cut, but recent data along with statements from policymakers have pushed Wall Street into looking in a more traditional quarter-point move, rather than a more aggressive half-point reduction. Beyond that, traders are expecting the Fed to lop a full percentage point off by the end of 2024, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. Fed officials of late have turned their attention more to a slowing labor market. The jobless claims report indicated that layoffs have not spiked, though the weekly number has risen slightly over the past several months. Continuing claims, which run a week behind edged just higher to 1.85 million, an increase of just 5,000 from the previous period."

        "header": "Consumer prices rose 0.2% in August as annual inflation rate hits lowest since early 2021",
        "content": "Inflation in August declined to its lowest level since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday that also showed a key measure higher than expected, setting the stage for an expected quarter percentage point rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The  consumer price index , a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, increased 0.2% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. That put the 12-month inflation rate at 2.5%, down 0.4 percentage point from the July level, slightly below the estimate for 2.6% and at its lowest level in 3 years. However, the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.3% for the month, slightly higher than the 0.2% estimate. The 12-month core inflation rate held at 3.2%, in line with the forecast. The slight uptick in core CPI keeps the Fed on defense against inflation, likely negating the probability of a more aggressive interest rate when policymakers meet next Tuesday and Wednesday. \"This isn't the CPI report the market wanted to see. With core inflation coming in higher than expected, the Fed's path to a 50 basis point cut has become more complicated,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. Stocks slumped  following the report, while Treasury yields were mixed. However, the market rebounded later in the day, recouping its losses as the major averages all turned positive. In the fed funds futures market, traders priced in an 85% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, interest rate reduction when its meeting concludes Sept. 18, according to the CME Group's  FedWatch  measure. A month ago, markets were leaning towards a 50 basis point cut. \"The number is certainly not an obstacle to policy action next week, but the hawks on the committee will likely seize on today's CPI report as evidence that the last mile of inflation needs to be handled with care and caution  a formidable reason to default to a 25 basis points reduction,\" Shah added. While the numbers showed that inflation slowly continued to moderate, housing-related costs remain an issue. The shelter component of the CPI, which has about a one-third weighting in the index, climbed 0.5%, accounting for about 70% of the core increase. The shelter index was up 5.2% year over year. Food prices rose just 0.1%, while energy costs slid 0.8%. Elsewhere in the report, used vehicle prices decreased 1%, medical care services declined 0.1% and apparel prices increased 0.3%. Egg prices rose 4.8%. Real earnings also increased for the month, with average hourly earnings outpacing the monthly CPI increase by 0.2%, the BLS said in  a separate release . On a 12-month basis, inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings rose 1.3%. The Fed's attention of late, however, has turned to  a slowing labor market . Job creation since April has slowed to nearly half what it was in the prior five months.  Central bankers are saying  that preventing a broader slowdown is now about as important as the fight against inflation, which in the summer of 2022 hit its highest level in more than 40 years. Regardless of what the Fed decides when its meeting concludes next Wednesday, markets already are pricing in lower rates. Treasury yields, particularly at the 2- and 10-year duration, are at their lowest levels in more than a year. A recession indicator known as an inverted yield curve has reversed recently, a move that often portends both rate cuts from the Fed as well as a slowdown in the economy. Wednesday's report offered more evidence that inflation is waning, though it remains above the Fed's 2% goal. There are pockets where prices either stayed elevated or turned higher. \"Although inflation has eased, it does not mean that the prices of things that people buy have actually fallen,\" said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. \"It just means that prices are not increasing as fast. In fact, U.S. consumers now are paying more than 20% more for goods and services than they were before the pandemic.\" Airline fares, for instance, increased 3.9% in August after falling the previous five months. Motor vehicle insurance also continued its trek higher, rising 0.6% to push the 12-month increase to 16.5%. Hospital and related services costs jumped 0.4% and are up 5.8% from last year. At the same time, a pullback in energy costs has helped bring down inflation figures. Gasoline was off 0.6% in August and is down 10.3% from a year ago, part of a 4% slide in the energy index that has included a 12.1% tumble for fuel oil prices."

Increasing demand for property, especially in the luxury space, is boosting prices not just of homes, but of everything else in the city  just as the United Arab Emirates is expected to emerge as the  world's top wealth magnet  for the third consecutive year. For Hussain Sajwani, chairman of Dubai property giant Damac, that spells both good and bad news. \"What concerns me a little bit in Dubai is that [it's] becoming an expensive city, and I've said this in the past, that Dubai [is] going to be [an] expensive city. Because whenever there is so much demand, and especially when talented people, average people are coming, they create more demand,\" Sajwani told CNBC's Dan Murphy from Riyadh on Tuesday. \"So today, to get a seat in a school is difficult ... and of course, the business is going to raise prices, and inflation [is] going to be high, so Dubai is going to be an expensive city,\" the chairman said. \"And I hope [the] government find ways and means. And it's not easy to find ways and means when there is a continuous influx of people to the city.\" The latest Dubai property market numbers tell a story of burgeoning demand.In July of 2024, property sales reached 49.6 billion dirhams ($13.5 billion), a 31.63% increase from the same period in 2023, according to locally-based brokerage firm Elite Merit Real Estate. \"The first half of 2024 alone saw over 43,000 property transactions valued at approximately AED122.9 billion, marking a 30% increase from the previous year,\" the firm's report released on Sept. 10 wrote, adding that the growth is due in part to the \"rapid absorption of new inventory.\" Around 80% of the units launched since 2022 have already been sold, the report estimates. \"The Dubai property market is doing extremely well, and I think we're going to continue to do well, because the demand in Europe is amazing,\" Sajwani said. \"Everybody wants to go to Dubai, from the taxi driver to the waiter to the businessman ... Dubai now is attracting a lot of not only wealthy people, but a lot of talented people. And it's growing in a different level from pre-Covid.\" The Damac founder noted the way in which the Covid-19 period supercharged Dubai's popularity as a place to live: while much of the world remained in lockdowns, the emirate encouraged tourism and attracted new residents with the help of visas for remote workers and entrepreneurship. \"Dubai today is a global city, by all means, and attracting a lot of talent and a lot of businesses, we're going to continue to grow,\" Sajwani said. Dubai has experienced a volatile boom-and-bust cycle in the past, most notably during its 2008-2009 crisis period, when the emirates' property market crashed, and numerous investors had to default on their debts. Asked if he was worried about a similar cycle repeated itself, Sajwani expressed confidence that the system was different now. Asked if Dubai is more stable now, Sajwani replied: \"100%.\" \"One of the key reason for that is that the regulations the Dubai government brought in after [the] '09 or '08 crash has been very good regulations. Very, very strict on developers, on customers, and on zoning,\" he said. \"So that regulation is helping  not everybody just can come and enter the market and just launch a project ... There is very strict escrow, so the customer's money is very much protected, and that's what makes the market very efficient.\" Correction: This article's headline has been updated to reflect Hussain Sajwani's title as chairman of Damac."

        "header": "U.S. Latino economic output grows to $3.6 trillion, new report finds",
        "content": "The U.S. Latino economy grew by 13% from $3.2 trillion in 2021 to $3.6 trillion in 2022, according to a new report released Thursday by economic think tank  Latino Donor Collaborative  and Wells Fargo. That would make the cohort the fifth-largest economy in the world  surpassing the annual output of India, the United Kingdom, France and Canada. \"There is no doubt that the U.S. Latino economy is a formidable force, characterized by strong GDP growth, significant population expansion, high workforce participation, and increased educational achievements,\" Sol Trujillo, Latino Donor Collaborative chairman, said in the report. \"This is not a matter of diversity and inclusion; it is a critical business strategy,\" Trujillo added. The report is based on data from 2022, the most recent year for which information is publicly available. It includes data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, among others. Looking at the world's 10 largest economies between 2017 and 2022, Latinos would be the second fastest-growing economy with a 4.6% annual average real growth rate, behind just China at 5.3%. The growth rate of the U.S. Latino gross domestic product, or GDP, is also 2.6 times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy. Industry strength for Latinos remained steady in manufacturing, public administration, accommodation and food services, construction, and transportation. By state, California led the way in Latino GDP in 2022 once again. Here's a look at the top five states by Latino GDP, per the report: The Latino economic boom has also led to a wealth boom for the group. Hispanic household wealth has tripled over the last decade, according to new data compiled by the Hispanic Wealth Project. That is two years ahead of a goal set out by the nonprofit, after Latinos lost up to two-thirds of their median household wealth in the wake of the Great Recession. By 2022, the median net worth of Hispanic households reached $63,400  3.17 times higher than in 2013, when adjusting for inflation. Increasing homeownership rates, rising home prices and a surge in Hispanic-owned businesses have all contributed to steady growth, the HPW reported. However, a significant gap remains when the group is compared with non-Hispanic white households, which had a median net worth of $283,300 in 2022. Median net worth was $192,160 for the general population. \"The U.S. Latino cohort is essential to our country's future,\" said Trujillo. The LDC also set a forecast for the U.S. Latino economy through 2029. It shows the cohort's economic output will surpass Japan's by 2024 and Germany's by 2027, based on national GDP forecasts from the International Monetary Fund. A significant part of that, Trujillo said, is due to the group's population growth rate. \"U.S. Latino population growth is nearly ubiquitous across the country.\" Latino economic growth is also expanding at a faster rate than that of non-Latinos in states such as Colorado, Washington and Georgia. Between 2021 and 2022, the U.S. Latino population increased by 1.65%, while the non-Latino population grew by just 0.08%. This growth has translated to the Latino population being significantly younger than its peers, with a large share of Latinos who have yet to enter the labor market. As a result, the U.S. economy is increasingly reliant on U.S. Latinos to replenish its working-age population, Trujillo said. \"A young Latino in the U.S. turns 18 every thirty seconds.\" \"Leveraging the unique and powerful opportunities presented by the U.S. Latino market will benefit every American,\" Trujillo said. The report's findings were released during the L'Attitude conference, which examines the state of Latino leadership, participation and representation in corporate America as well as in the public, media and entertainment sectors."

        "content": "LONDON  The U.K. economy continued to flatline in July on a month-on-month basis, flash figures published from the Office for National Statistics showed Wednesday. Gross domestic product (GDP) came in below the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, who had forecast growth of 0.2%. The country also logged no GDP growth in June. Britain's dominant services sector showed slight growth of 0.1% in the month to July, while production and construction output fell by 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Britain's economic growth was up 0.5% in the three month to July, slightly below economist expectations and the 0.6% recorded in the second quarter ending in June. \"The economy recorded no growth for the second month running, though longer term strength in the services sector meant there was growth over the last three months as a whole,\" Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said. The U.K. economy had recorded modest but steady expansion almost every month so far this year, having emerged from a  shallow recession  at the start of the year. The reading is the first under Prime Minister Keir Starmer's new Labour government, which was  elected on July 4 . Finance Minister Rachel Reeves said the print left her \"under no illusion\" of the challenges faced by the U.K. economy. \"I will be honest with the British people that change will not happen overnight. Two quarters of positive economic growth does not make up for fourteen years of stagnation,\" Reeves said. It comes ahead of the forthcoming Oct. 30 Autumn Statement, when Reeves will reveal her annual budget. She has already warned will be painful after she said she inherited a 22 billion ($29 billion) hole in the public finances from the former Conservative government. He predecessor Jeremy Hunt has denied the claims, describing the alleged black hole as \"fiction.\" Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said the prospect of tax raises could add further caution to consumer spending over the coming months. \"Tax rises have been flagged ahead of the Autumn Budget, and consumers and businesses may feel rather more cautious heading into the winter months as they await details from the Treasury,\" she said. But she added that further movement in interest rates anticipated from the Bank of England could help ease wider growth pressures. The central bank is set to meet next week for its latest policy decision, after  cutting rates  for the first time in four years last month. \"This month may just be a blip however, given recent positive noises that have been sounded about the state of the wider economy, especially as rate cuts will continue to be delivered over the coming year,\" James noted."

        "header": "Two key inflation reports this week will help decide the size of the Fed's interest rate cut",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve gets its last look this week at inflation readings before it will determine the size of a widely expected interest rate cut soon. On Wednesday, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its consumer price index report for August. A day later, the BLS issues its producer price index report, also for August, a measure used as a proxy for costs at the wholesale level. With  the issue virtually settled  over whether the Fed is going to cut rates when it wraps up the next policy meeting Sept. 18, the only question is by how much. Friday's  jobs report  provided little clarity on the issue, so it will be left to the CPI and PPI readings hopefully to clear things up. \"Inflation data has taken a backseat to labor market data in terms of influence on Fed policy,\" Citigroup economist Veronica Clark said in a note. \"But with markets  and likely Fed officials themselves  split on the appropriate size of the first rate cut on September 18, August CPI data could remain an important factor in the upcoming decision.\" The Dow Jones consensus forecast is for a 0.2% increase in the CPI, both for the all-items measure and the core that excludes volatile food and energy items. On an annual basis, that is expected to translate into respective inflation rates of 2.6% and 3.2%. PPI also is projected to increase 0.2% on both headline and core. Fed officials generally put more emphasis on core as a better indicator of longer-run trends. At least for CPI, the readings are not particularly close to the Fed 2% long-run target. But there are a few important caveats to remember. First, while the Fed pays attention to the CPI, it is not its principal yardstick for inflation. That would be the Commerce Department's  personal consumption expenditures price index , which most recently pegged headline inflation at 2.5% in July. Second, policymakers are as concerned about the direction of movement almost as much as the absolute value, and the trend for the past several months has been a decided moderation in inflation. On headline prices in particular, the August 12-month CPI forecast would represent a 0.3 percentage point decline from July. Finally, the  focus for Fed officials has shifted , from a laser view on taming inflation to mushrooming fears over the state of the labor market. Hiring has slowed considerably since April, with the average monthly gain in nonfarm payrolls down to 135,000 from 255,000 in the prior five months, and  job openings have declined . As the focus on labor has intensified, so has the expectation for the Fed to start rolling back rates. The benchmark fed funds rate currently stands at 5.25% to 5.50%. \"The August CPI report should show more progress in getting the inflation rate back down to the Fed's 2.0 percent target,\" wrote Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \"Barring some extraordinary surprises, there should be nothing in this report that would deter the Fed from making a rate cut and quite possibly a large one.\" Markets, however, seem to have made their peace with the Fed starting out slowly. Futures market pricing on Tuesday indicated 71% odds that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will kick off the easing campaign with a quarter percentage point reduction, and just a 29% chance of a more aggressive half-point cut, according to the  CME Group's FedWatch . Some economists, though, think that could be a mistake. Citing the general pullback in hiring coupled with substantial downward revisions of previous months' jobs counts, Samuel Tombs, Pantheon Macroeconomics' chief U.S. economist, thinks the \"summer slowdown probably will look even sharper in a few months' time,\" and the downtrend in hiring \"has much further to run.\" \"We're therefore disappointed  but not surprised  that FOMC members who spoke after the jobs report, but before the pre-meeting blackout, are still leaning towards a 25 [basis point] easing this month,\" Tombs said in a note Monday. \"But by the meeting in November, with two more employment reports in hand, the case for rapid rate cuts will be overwhelming.\" Indeed, market pricing, while indicating a tepid start to cuts in September, projects a half-point reduction in November and possibly another in December."

Recent readings showed pricing pressures increasingly on their way to the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target, but reports on  employment  and  manufacturing  have revealed some signs of softening. Investors will get some additional key data this week, with the consumer price index and producer price index coming Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. But Dimon worries that a raft of inflationary forces on the horizon, such as higher deficits and increased infrastructure spending, will continue to add pressure to an economy still reeling from the impact of higher interest rates. \"They're all inflationary, basically in the short run, the next couple of years,\" Dimon said. \"So, it's hard to look at [it] and say, 'Well, no, we're out of the woods.' I don't think so.\" The bank leader has previously warned of an economic slowdown. In August, he said the odds of a \"soft landing\" were  around 35% to 40%,  implying a recession is the more likely outcome."

        "header": "'Spook the West': Turkey's bid for BRICS both a strategic and symbolic step, analysts say",
        "content": "Turkey's request to join the BRICS alliance is a move seen as both strategic and symbolic as the Eurasian country of 85 million makes increasing strides in its influence and leverage on the global stage. \"Our president has already expressed multiple times that we wish to become a member of BRICS,\" a spokesperson for Turkey's leading AK Party told journalists earlier in September. \"Our request in this matter is clear, and the process is proceeding within this framework.\" BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is a group of emerging market countries that seek to deepen their economic ties. This year, it gained four new members: Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the UAE. It's also seen as a counterweight to Western-led organizations like the EU, the G7 and even NATO, although it lacks formal structure, enforcement mechanisms, and uniform rules and standards. For Turkey, a longtime Western ally and NATO member since 1952, the move to join BRICS is \"in line with its broader geopolitical journey: positioning itself as an independent actor in a multi-polar world and even becoming a pole of power in its own right,\" George Dyson, a senior analyst atControl Risks, told CNBC. \"This is not to say that Turkey is turning away from the West entirely,\" Dyson added, \"but Turkey wants to foster as many trading ties as possible and pursue opportunities unilaterally without being constrained by Western alignment. It is definitely symbolic in that Turkey is demonstrating exactly this  that it is not constrained by its good ties with the West.\" Despite decades of being aligned with Europe and the U.S., Turkey has faced consistent rejection from joining the EU, which has long been a sore spot for Ankara. Ambassador Matthew Bryza, a former White House and Senior State Department officialcurrently based in Istanbul, said that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government \"seem to be motivated mostly by two factors:A strategic tradition ofsecuring national interests... and a desire to spook the West a bit, both out of emotional spite and as a negotiating tactic to extract concessions.\" CNBC has contacted the Turkish presidency's office for comment. Turkey has in the last few years  expanded its role in global diplomacy,  brokering prisoner swap deals and leading other negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, for instance, while also mending previously strained relations with regional powers like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and most recently, Egypt. Ankara also refuses to partake in sanctions against Russia  a stance that irks its Western allies but helps it maintain an independent position as  a so-called \"middle power,\"  which it sees as beneficial to its relationships with China and the Global South. To that end, \"any new BRICS member is obviously eager to take advantage of stronger 'togetherness' of emerging economies in order to reduce dependency on developed economies, mainly the United States,\" said Arda Tunca, an independent economist and consultant based in Turkey. Tunca noted, however, that Turkey's unique position in the world is a \"delicate discussion point\" as the country has \"serious political problems with the EU and the United States\" despite its western alliances. Turkey's governing party, which has run the country for 22 years, is \"ideologically closer to the East than the West,\" Tunca said. \"Turkey wanted to hop on the BRICS train before it was late. It is too early to mention that the BRICS can become an alternative to the West, but the intention is clearly to stand up against the West under the leadership of China.\" Importantly, being part of BRICS allows its members to trade in currencies other than dollars. This aims to reduce dependency on the U.S.-led system and usher in a more multi-polar world.The fact that it's led by China makes some in the West wary, who see this as a potential win for Beijing. \"I don't think there is any enforcement of their [BRICS'] decisions, it's more of a geopolitical thing, sort of a symbolic counter to the G7,\" Dyson said. He also noted: \"It's interesting that Iran and UAE are both in it. It's a bit like the anti-West team.\" Erdogan has spoken of his desire to join BRICS since at least 2018, but the issue was never formalized. In June, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan visited both China and Russia, the latter for a BRICS+ summit, during which Russian President Vladimir Putin said he \"welcomed\" Turkey's interest in joining the bloc. At the time, the then-U.S. ambassador to Turkey, Jeff Flake, said in an interview that  he hoped Turkey wouldn't join the group,  but added that he did not think it would negatively impact Turkey's alignment with the West."

        "header": "Draghi urges radical European Union reform requiring extra 800 billion euros a year",
        "content": "The European Union needs up to 800 billion euros ($884 billion) in additional investment per year to meet its key competitiveness and climate targets, according to a report from economist and politician Mario Draghi. The bloc's goals of bolstering its geopolitical relevance, social equality and decarbonization are being threatened by weak economic growth and productivity compared with the U.S. and China, the report states. The wide-ranging study led by Draghi  who previously served as prime minister of Italy and president of the European Central Bank during the euro zone debt crisis  found EU priorities must include reducing energy prices, strengthening competitiveness, coordinating industrial policy and raising defense investment. The EU must also adapt to a world where \"dependencies are becoming vulnerabilities and it can no longer rely on others for its security,\" the report found, citing the EU's dependence on China for critical minerals, and China's reliance on the EU for absorbing its industrial overcapacity. The EU's high level of trade openness will leave it exposed if trends toward supply chain autonomy accelerate, the report continues. Roughly 40% of Europe's imports come from a small number of suppliers which are difficult to replace, and around half of this volume originates from countries with which the bloc is not \"strategically aligned,\" it says. \"The EU will need to develop a genuine \"foreign economic policy\" that coordinates preferential trade agreements and direct investment with resource-rich nations, the building up of stockpiles in selected critical areas, and the creation of industrial partnerships to secure the supply chain of key technologies,\" the report states. The EU will need to ensure dependencies do not increase and look to \"harness the potential of domestic resources through mining, recycling and innovation in alternative materials.\" Other goals include full implementation of the single market, which includes 440 million consumers and 23 million companies, by reducing trade friction. The bloc must also seek to ensure its competition policy does not become a \"barrier to Europe's goals,\" particularly in the technology sector. The European coalition must also facilitate \"massive investment needs unseen for half a century in Europe,\" through a mix of private finance and public support. The EU is meanwhile suffering an \"innovation deficit\" which must be tackled through reforms to research and development funding and policy, the report states. Across many sectors, the report calls for greater harmonization of policy and focusing of funding. In clean technology development, for example, it found financial support was fractured among different programs, while manufacturers were struggling to compete globally, given Chinese subsidies and the huge domestic support provided by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. On steps to mobilize private finance, the report recommends transitioning the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) from a co-ordinator of national regulators into a single regulator for all EU securities markets able to focus on overarching goals, similar to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). To fast-track policymaking, the report proposes limiting the voting items that require support from an absolute majority of member states. Public and private investments are being hindered by the size of the EU budget, its lack of focus and its risk aversion, the Draghi report says. It adds that looming repayments of the huge debt-financed NextGenerationEU Covid-19 recovery program starting in 2028 mean that the EU's effective spending power will be reduced without a decision on sourcing new resources. Certain areas of spending proposals, including defense projects and cross-border grids, will require \"common funding,\" it continues, adding that the EU should move toward \"regular issuance of common safe assets to enable joint investment projects among Member States and to help integrate capital markets.\" Germany, traditionally resistant to moves toward additional common borrowing, responded to the proposals on Monday. \"The communalization of risks and liability creates democratic and fiscal issues. Germany will not agree to that,\" Finance Minister Christian Lindner said, according to a CNBC translation of a Reuters report. The EU's total investment-to-GDP rate will have to rise by around 5 percentage points of EU GDP per year to levels last seen in the 1960s and 70s to meet defense, digitalization and decarbonization targets, according to the study. Overall, the objectives set out would require a minimum annual additional investment of 750 to 800 billion euros, according to European Commission estimates. The report was commissioned last year by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who was  elected for a second five-year term  in July and is set to appoint new Commissioners this week. Some analysts were quick to pour cold water on the scale of the resulting reform. The findings \"will trigger a crucial debate for the future of the EU/Eurozone, but there is no need to hold your breath,\" Lorenzo Codogno, founder of Lorenzo Codogno Macro Advisors, said in comments emailed ahead of the report's release. \"Nothing will happen until the new Commission becomes fully operational, and even after that, the tricky, fragmented and fragile political situation across member states makes it challenging to obtain the political support necessary for action. Still, some surprises cannot be ruled out, and thus, the political debate that will follow needs to be monitored carefully,\" he said. David Roche, founder of Independent Strategy, said the report would not result in an immediate market impact. \"The gap between US and EU productivity could be bridged by [Draghi's] proposals to integrate nationally based supply side sectors and markets and boosting public and private investment massively. But it won't happen,\" Roche said in a note Monday, describing Europe as \"paralysed by populism and incompetence at the national level.\" - CNBC's Sophie Kiderlin contributed reporting."

        "header": "Many 'doubted the vision': Saudi investment minister touts 'green shoring' on path to diversification",
        "content": "Saudi Minister of Investment Khalid al-Falih pushed back against skepticism over the country's economic diversification plan, as Riyadh touts \"green shoring\" investment opportunities to woo foreign financing. \"There was many people who doubted the vision, the ambition, how broad and deep and comprehensive it is, and whether the development of a country like KSA who is so dependent for so many decades on a commodity business like oil would be able to do what we are aspiring to do with Vision 2030,\" al-Falih told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on Saturday at the Ambrosetti Forum in Cernobbio, Italy. One of the largest economies in the Middle East and a key U.S. ally in the region, Saudi Arabia has been shoring up investments in a bid to materialize Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 economic diversification program, which spans 14 giga-projects, including the Neom industrial complex. Under this initiative, Riyadh seeks to pivot away from its historical dependence on oil revenues  which the International Monetary Fund  now sees  rising until 2026, before starting to descend  and  hopes  to draw financial flows in the domestic economy exceeding $3 trillion, as well as push foreign domestic investment to $100 billion a year by 2030. The Saudi minister on Saturday said that, eight years into manifesting Vision 2030, the kingdom is now \"more committed, more determined\" to the program and has already implemented or is about to complete 87% of its targets. Critics of the plan have previously questioned whether Riyadh will successfully deliver on its goals by its stated deadline. In recent years, the kingdom has been attempting to liberalize its market and improve its business environment with  reforms  to its investment and labor laws  but has also formulated less popular requirements for companies to  set up their regional headquarters  in Saudi Arabia to access government contracts. The number of foreign investment licenses issued in Saudi Arabia nearly doubled in 2023, the IMF noted, with  government data  pointing to a 5.6% annual increase in net flows of foreign direct investment in the first quarter. Concerns have nevertheless lingered over the potential uncertainty and unpredictability of the kingdom's legal framework and its dispute resolution system for foreign investment. Al-Falih insisted that Saudi Arabia boasts predictability, as well as domestic political and economic stability. The Saudi investment minister said that part of Riyadh's offering to foreign investors is the Saudi-coined initiative of \"green shoring,\" which seeks to decarbonize supply chains in areas with renewable energy resources. \"Green shoring is basically saying you need to do more of the high energy processing [and] manufacturing value add in areas where the materials, as well as the energy, are [located],\" al-Falih said, adding that Saudi Arabia has the logistics, capital and infrastructure to achieve this. Under Vision 2030, the world's largest oil exporter aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. Along with its neighbor, the United Arab Emirates  which hosted the 2023 gathering of the annual U.N. Conference of the Parties  Riyadh has been a high-profile presence at climate summits, but has still drawn questions over its commitment to decarbonization. Riyadh  along with other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries oil alliance  has repeatedly called for the simultaneous use of hydrocarbons and green resources in order to avoid energy shortages throughout the global transition to net-zero emissions. Some climate activists have also  criticized  Saudi Arabia's promotion of solutions like carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies as a smokescreen to push ahead with its lucrative oil business. As part of \"green shoring,\" Saudi Arabia sets out to \"address global supply chain resilience issues\" and \"build a new global economy that is certainly moving more electric, as we bring the copper, as we bring the lithium, the cobalt, the other critical materials, rare earth metals, as we address semiconductor shortages, green fertilizers, green chemicals,\" al-Falih stressed."

The bloc's economy underwent \"overall a weak growth, but nothing of the terrible prophecies that we heard in the last two or three years: recessions, blackouts, divergence, divisions in Europe in front of Russia's invasion,\" Gentiloni said in an interview with CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Forum at Cernobbio, on the shores of Italy's Lake Como.

And the risks of differences among the European Union, that was very high when the pandemic happened, are very limited,\" he noted. \"The bad part of the story is that if we don't raise out capacity in terms of competitiveness, if we don't make enormous progress in what we call the capital markets union, and if we don't address the challenge of defense  if we don't do that, well, the new situation of the world will appear very difficult for Europeans.\" Resurging from the Covid-19 pandemic, Europe has been battling a cost-of-living crisis and high-inflation environment exacerbated by Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and energy supply tightness following sanctions against Moscow. The euro zone's economy has expanded in the first half of this year, with flash figures showing better-than-expected  gross domestic product growth of 0.3%  in the three months to the end of June, compared with the previous quarter. In its spring forecasts , the European Commission projected the EU's GDP will swell by 1% in 2024 and by 0.8% in the euro area, with respective growth of 1.6% and 1.4% in the two regions in 2024. At the time, the Commission flagged growth on the back of accelerated private consumption, declining inflation and a strong labor market,but alsobroader geopolitical risks amid ongoing conflicts in Ukraineandthe Middle East. Amid a drop in inflation, the ECB in June took the  first step to ease monetary policy since 2019 , trimming the central bank's key rate to 3.75%, down from a record 4% where it has been since September 2023. As of Friday, markets had fully priced in another ECB rate cut in its forthcoming meeting of Sept. 12.  Looking ahead, Europe must now weather the dual storm of close-call elections in key trade partner the U.S. in November, and frictions in its trade relationship China. The EU has come into Beijing's crosshairs following the bloc's June decision to impose  higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle  imports that were found benefit \"heavily from unfair subsidies\" and pose a \"threat of economic injury\" to EV producers in Europe. Gentiloni on Saturday stressed that trade diplomacy with China and the war in Ukraine must top the agenda of challenges facing a new Commission  and that they are more pressing concerns than the advent of a potential second U.S. administration under former President Donald Trump. The European Union must \"support Ukraine, keep the doors of international trade open\" but also \"abandon our ingenuity in the trade relation with China. But this does not mean that we can accept the idea that international trade and international trade rules [are] over,\" Gentiloni noted. He downplayed the economic impact of a Trump victory in November, adding, \"I think that a change in the U.S. administration, meaning Trump winning the election, of course it will not be welcome in Brussels, but I don't think that the change would be enormous in terms of economic relations.\" Gentiloni has yet to announce his next steps after departing from the Commission, at a time when Europe and its legislative body face a rising wave of far-right support. \"You should never organize your next role when you are having a role. But of course I will give my contribution to European affairs and maybe also to Italian politics and Italian affairs,\" he said Saturday. The leftist politician was unlikely to garner the support of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has nominated Minister for European Affairs Raffaele Fitto from the ranks of her right-wing Brothers of Italy party to join the new EU executive. Far-right factions gained  substantive ground in the latest European election , leading the right-wing prime minister of Hungary  which currently holds the presidency of the EU Council  Viktor Orbn to question whether a van der Leyen Commission is appropriate, given the political sentiment. \"The core of the difficulty is the following: the previous Commission proved to be very much unsuccessful, in terms of competitiveness, of European economy, migration, stopping the war. So generally speaking, it was an unsuccessful Commission,\" the Hungarian leader told CNBC's Sedgwick on Friday, noting that a decision was taken to \"create the same Commission, basically.\" He added: \" So I have [a] great belief that [people] can change and be able to deliver better performances than they have done previously. But [is is] difficult to think so. So I try to support the Commission as much as we can, but being a rational man, I think we neglected the desire of the voters for change, and the same establishment [is] still in position in Brussels, and it's not good.\"  CNBC's Katrina Bishop contributed to this report."

        "header": "Fed Governor Waller backs interest rate cut at September meeting, open to larger move",
        "content": "Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Friday backed an interest rate cut at the upcoming central bank policy meeting in less than two weeks, and indicated he'd be open to a substantial reduction if necessary. \"Considering the achieved and continuing progress on inflation and moderation in the labor market, I believe the time has come to lower the target range for the federal funds rate at our upcoming meeting,\" Waller said in remarks prepared for the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Other policymakers recently have advocated easing policy soon, but this is one of the clearest indications it will happen at the Sept. 17-18 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Waller repeated verbiage that Fed Chair  Jerome Powell  used in late August  that the \"time has come\" for adjustments to monetary policy. \"Determining the pace of rate cuts and ultimately the total reduction in the policy rate are decisions that lie in the future,\" Waller added. He noted that he is \"open-minded about the size and pace of cuts\" and said, \"If the data suggests the need for larger cuts, then I will support that as well.\" His remarks followed a weaker-than-expected  nonfarm payrolls report Friday  that added to the belief that the pace of hiring is weakening. The Labor Department reported job growth of 142,000, higher than July but still below the 161,000 Dow Jones forecast. Waller did not specify how much he thinks the Fed should cut or how frequently. But he said he is open to the possibility that it may need to be aggressive in keeping the labor market afloat as inflation moderates toward the central bank's 2% goal. He noted that if the labor market deteriorates more quickly than expected, the Fed should react with larger cuts, which he said would lead to \"a greater likelihood of achieving a soft landing.\" \"Furthermore, I do not expect this first cut to be the last. With inflation and employment near our longer-run goals and the labor market moderating, it is likely that a series of reductions will be appropriate,\" he said. Futures market pricing following the jobs report tilted toward a greater likelihood of a quarter percentage point rate reduction this month. But it also indicated more aggressive moves later in the year, with a half-point move in November and possibly another in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure."

The growth was led by leisure and hospitality and health care and social assistance, with each category adding more than 40,000 jobs, according to data from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics . If private education is included with the health-care group, as some economists do, that category would have grown by 47,000 jobs. Elsewhere in the report, related categories of jobs saw conflicting data. Construction was a bright spot, growing by 34,000 jobs, but manufacturing shed 24,000 jobs. Professional and business services ticked up by 8,000 jobs, but information lost 7,000. \"The job growth is coming really from only three places right now: leisure and hospitality, health and education services, and government.  We're just not seeing a lot of growth in business and professional services, and I think that is indicative of an economy that's slowing down,\" former Department of Labor chief economist Betsey Stevenson said on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\" Even some of the stronger categories showed a slowdown, at least temporarily. The health-care subsector added 31,000 jobs, or about half its average over the prior 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics."

        "header": "Friday\u2019s jobs report for August is going to be huge. Here\u2019s what to expect",
        "content": "Wall Street is gearing up for one of the most important economic releases of the year Friday, when the Labor Department puts out a jobs report expected to go a long way in determining the future of Federal Reserve policy. The Wall Street consensus is for nonfarm payrolls growth of 161,000 for August and a slight decline in the unemployment rate to 4.2%, according to Dow Jones. However, recent data, including a  massive downward revision  to previous counts, has pointed to a sharp slowdown in hiring and has put some downside risk to that forecast. In turn, markets are certain the Fed will start lowering interest rates in a couple weeks, with the possibility of a jumbo cut depending on what Fridays report shows. The labor market has cooled faster than we originally had been told, so thats whats calling [Fridays report] into question, said Giacomo Santangelo, economist at job search site Monster. What the Fed is going to do in response, how are they going to adjust rates, thats why we are having this conversation. While job growth has been tailing off through much of 2024, the deceleration hit home for the market with a July report that showed  payroll growth of just 114,000 . That wasnt even the lowest number of the year, but it followed  a Fed meeting  that stirred up sentiment the central bank was being too complacent about a weakening economy and might hold interest rates high for too long. What has followed has been a series of reports indicating that while the economy is still on its feet,  hiring is decelerating , the manufacturing sector is fading further into contraction, and its time for the Fed to start cutting before it risks overdoing its inflation fight and dragging the economy into recession. The latest bad news came Thursday when payrolls processing firm ADP put  August private job growth at just 99,000 , the smallest gain since January 2021. If theyre too aggressive for too long a period of time, without easing on monetary policy, this could lead to the giant R and we dont even want to say the word, Santangelo said, referring to recession. If God forbid this does lead to an economic downturn, all fingers are going to point toward the Fed. Markets consequently are expecting the Fed to lower benchmark rates by at least a quarter percentage point when its next meeting concludes Sept. 18, with the possibility rising of  a half-point reduction . The Fed hasnt reduced its benchmark rate by half a point since the emergency cuts during the early Covid days. Traders are pricing in a succession of cuts that would shave about 2.25 percentage points off the fed funds rate through 2025, futures contracts show. The benchmark overnight borrowing rate is currently targeted in a range between 5.25%-5.5%. Such an aggressive easing posture would indicate not merely an effort to normalize rates from their 23-year high but also reflect a deeper economic pullback. In the more immediate term, though, the move lower would be targeted more at a labor market still feeling aftershocks from the Covid pandemic. Monster job search data is still heavily tilted toward health care-related positions, which have flourished in the current era, while the most common search terms are work from home, part time and remote, reflecting the move to a hybrid environment. Santangelo said there also is still a substantial skills gap in the labor market, despite a sharp narrowing in the gulf between open jobs and available workers, which has contracted to about 1.1 to 1 from 2 to 1 a couple years ago. The jobs that are being created are not necessarily suited for the people who are getting laid off. We still have a huge skills gap. The easiest place to see that is health care, he said. The No.1 thing that job seekers are looking for is more flexibility. Theres that kind of gap between employers and job seekers also. Workers in turn are getting more pessimistic about the state of play in the labor market. The  Zeta Economic Index , which uses artificial intelligence to track various economic metrics, is showing that concerns about jobs are accelerating  even though the broader economy is still performing well. A measure of job market sentiment fell 1% in August and is down 4.6% from a year ago, Zeta figures show. The gauges new mover index dropped 9.9% on the month, reflecting worries over job stability. Despite a resilient economy ... job market concerns persist. The job sentiment dip, paired with the mixed bag of consumer behavior, signals an ongoing caution in the workforce, said David Steinberg, co-founder and chairman of Zeta Global, which compiles the index. As the economy shows signs of a soft landing, the persistent caution regarding job stability continues to temper broader economic optimism. The Zeta data mirrors a recent Conference Board survey, which reflected a sharp narrowing of the gap between respondents saying jobs were easy to find as opposed to hard to get. Markets also will be watching the wage component of Fridays report, though that has become less of an issue lately  as inflation has moderated . The consensus is for average hourly earnings to post a 0.3% increase on the month and a 3.7% year-over-year move, both 0.1 percentage point higher than July."

        "header": "Unemployment among Black workers falls in August, bucking trend from other groups",
        "content": "The unemployment rate for Black workers fell in August, according to data released Friday  by the Department of Labor . In August, Black workers saw their jobless rate fall to 6.1% from 6.3% in the month prior. This trend was in line with the overall unemployment rate for the country, which ticked down to 4.2% in August from July. On the other hand, unemployment for white workers held steady at 3.8%. The jobless rate also rose for Asian and Hispanic workers. For the former, it increased to 4.1% from 3.7%. For the latter, it crept higher to 5.5% from 5.3%. Black men experienced a big month-to-month drop in unemployment, with their jobless rates falling to 5.9% from 6.6%. On the other hand, the unemployment rate held steady at 5.5% for Black women. While Hispanic women saw their jobless rate fall to 5% from 5.4%, unemployment rates for their male counterparts climbed to 4.8% from 4.4%. The unemployment rate for white men also ticked higher to 3.6% from 3.5%, while it was unchanged at 3.4% for white women. Diving into the employment-to-population ratio for female prime-age workers, or those ages 25 to 54, paints a very optimistic view of the labor market, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"The employment-to-population ratio for women's prime-age workers remains at a quarter-century high,\" she told CNBC. \"This remains very strong, even if there is still a little bit of softening in other measures.\" \"It makes sense we'll see some weakness now that we're approaching full employment,\" Gould added. Last month, the labor force participation rate  the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking work  remained unchanged at 62.7%. Among white workers, the rate steadied, while it fell to 62.7% from 63.2% for Black workers. Within Asian workers, the participation slipped to 65.4% from 65.7%, and rose among Hispanic workers to 67.8% from 67.3%.  CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report. Correction: The unemployment rate for Black women held steady at 5.5%. A previous version misstated the percentage."

        "content": "The U.S. economy created slightly fewer jobs than expected in August, reflecting a slowing labor market while also clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates later this month. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 142,000 during the month, up from 89,000 in July and below the 161,000 consensus forecast from Dow Jones, according to  a report Friday  from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the same time, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%, as expected. The labor force expanded by 120,000 for the month, helping push the jobless level down by 0.1 percentage point, though the labor force participation rate held at 62.7%. An alternative measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged up to 7.9%, its highest reading since October 2021. The household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate and is often more volatile than the survey of establishments, showed employment growth of 168,000. The balance, though, tilted toward part-time employment, which increased by 527,000, while full-time fell by 438,000. Markets showed little initial reaction to the data, with stock futures holding negative and Treasury yields also lower. However,  stocks sold off  later in the session. While the August numbers were close to expectations, the previous two months saw substantial downward revisions. The BLS cut July's total by 25,000, while June fell to 118,000, a downward revision of 61,000. \"I don't like this a whole lot. It's not disaster, but it's below expectations on the headline, and what really bothers me is the revisions,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"This is certainly going the wrong way.\" From a sector standpoint, construction led with 34,000 additional jobs. Other substantial gainers included health care, with 31,000, and social assistance, which saw growth of 13,000. Manufacturing lost 24,000 on the month. On wages, average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% on the month and 3.8% from a year ago, both higher than the respective estimates for 0.3% and 3.7%. Hours worked nudged higher to 34.3. The report comes with markets on edge over the next step for the Fed, which has been on hold with rates since July 2023 after having enacted a series of sharp increases to bring down inflation. Heading into the release, markets had been pricing in a 100% probability that the Fed will start cutting rates when it meets Sept. 17-18. The only question was how much. Following the payrolls release, futures market pricing briefly tilted towards a half percentage point cut but then switched back to a quarter point, according to the CME Group's  FedWatch  gauge. \"For the Fed, the decision comes down to deciding which is the bigger risk: reigniting inflation pressures if they cut by 50 [basis points] or threatening recession if they only cut by 25 [basis points],\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"On balance, with inflation pressures subdued, there is no reason for the Fed not to err on the side of caution and frontload rate cuts.\" The recent narrative for the economic data has indicated continuing growth but a slowdown for the labor market. Payrolls processing firm ADP reported Thursday that private companies added just 99,000 jobs in August, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that layoffs surged in August and hiring had hit its slowest year-to-date pace going back to at least 2005. The BLS report indicated that the private sector added 118,000 jobs for the month, up from 74,000 in July. Government jobs increased by 24,000. Most Fed officials have indicated that they also see rates coming down. In his pivotal annual speech at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conclave, Chair  Jerome Powell  proclaimed that \"the time has come\" to adjust policy, though he provided no specifics for what that meant. In a speech Friday morning, New York Fed President John Williams endorsed rate cuts. \"With the economy now in equipoise and inflation on a path to 2 percent, it is now appropriate to dial down the degree of restrictiveness in the stance of policy by reducing the target range for the federal funds rate,\" Williams said in remarks before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York."

        "header": "PayPal CEO's first year was praised by Wall Street, but hard part starts now for struggling payments company ",
        "content": "In January , about a hundred days into his job as  PayPal  CEO, Alex Chriss told CNBC's David Faber that the payments company hadn't had much to celebrate in recent years. But Chriss confidently said he was prepared to \"shock the world.\" \"I love being an underdog,\" Chriss said in an interview on \" Squawk on the Street ,\" from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. He was responding to a question about a recent spate of analyst downgrades. Dan Dolev of Mizuho Securities was among the skeptics. He cut his rating to the equivalent of a hold on Jan. 16, the day before Chriss' CNBC appearance, headlining his report, \"PayPal faces competitive pressure from 'A' to 'Z.'\" The A was for  Apple  Pay, and the Z represented payments app  Zelle , a money transfer service jointly owned by seven of the top U.S. banks. A few weeks later, PayPal  issued weak guidance  in its fourth-quarter earnings report, knocking the stock down 11% and justifying Dolev's concerns. PayPal appeared to be in deep trouble. Its market cap was down more than 80% since peaking in mid-2021. The company had just  cut 9% of it workforce , about 2,500 jobs, and was mired in single-digit growth. Analysts across Wall Street saw rising competition and a declining take rate, or the percentage of revenue PayPal keeps from each transaction. Fast forward to today, and the picture is dramatically brighter for the 26-year-old Silicon Valley company and its 47-year-old CEO. Chriss hit his one-year anniversary at the helm on Friday. In the third quarter, which ended on Monday, PayPal shares jumped 34%, their biggest quarterly rally since mid-2020, when the early days of the Covid pandemic fueled a surge in online shopping. It was the first time in eight quarters that PayPal outperformed the Nasdaq, which gained just 2.6% in the past three months. Dolev  bolstered his rating  back to a buy in May. In July, the company  lifted its full-year profit forecast  for a second time and increased share repurchases. Chriss said in the  earnings release  that the company was now \"operating from a position of strength.\" The stock rose almost 9%, its best day since late 2022. \"I think he's been nothing but a phenomenal success story so far,\" Dolev said. \"The news flow has been out of this world amazing, in terms of the way they manage expectations.\" Susquehanna's James Friedman  lifted his rating  on PayPal to a buy in early July. He said Chriss was \"setting the bar high\" with his comments on CNBC, but said he's been delivering on his bold promise to shareholders. \"You know how he shocked the world?\" Friedman said. \"He actually beat his numbers.\" Much of Chriss' early success has been tied to improved transaction margins and better monetization of key acquisitions like Braintree, which is used by  Meta  for credit card processing, and payments app Venmo, which is becoming more popular with businesses. Having cut a lot of the fat in the organization and with a renewed focus on profitability, Chriss has finally sparked some excitement on Wall Street after succeeded Dan Schulman, who  retired  following almost a decade as CEO. \"It was time for some new blood at PayPal,\" said Dana Stalder, a startup investor at venture firm Matrix Partners who served as PayPal's commercial chief from 2004 to 2008. \"He's made a lot of changes very quickly, and I think he has substantially increased the focus on the consumer, which is the right thing.\" Now comes the harder part  reigniting growth. Analysts are projecting roughly 6% revenue growth when PayPal reports third-quarter results in about a month, according to LSEG. For the fourth quarter, they expect growth of 5.5%. Sales are only expected to get marginally stronger in 2024, with analysts expecting growth of under 8% for the full year. PayPal didn't make Chriss available for an interview for this story. In the July earnings call, Chriss said of the firm's next steps that \"while change takes time and we still have much work ahead of us, we are well positioned today, have the right leadership in place and are moving full steam ahead.\" Chriss, who spent 19 years at tax software provider  Intuit  before joining PayPal, took little time before he started overhauling the management team. In November, he brought in Isabel Cruz from  Walmart  as chief people officer, Michelle Gill from Intuit to run a new small business and financial services group, Diego Scotti from Verizon to oversee the consumer group as well as marketing and communications, and  Jamie Miller  from EY as CFO. \"He has turned over, from what I can tell, the vast majority of the leadership team,\" Stalder said. \"It's been wholesale changes.\" Early in his tenure, Chriss publicly identified some of the reasons, in his view, that PayPal had been struggling to find its footing. He highlighted an overly aggressive strategy of expansion through deal-making. \"We have done too many acquisitions over the last few years, and we've been defocused,\" Chriss said in the January interview with Faber. \"It was one of the things I noticed when I came in 100 days ago.\" Chriss added that the company had narrowed down its priorities to five key things, \"all focused on profitable growth.\" The most important metric to fix, he said, was transaction margin dollars, which is how the company gauges the profitability of its core business. Among Chriss' strategies to address the deteriorating margin was to offer merchants increased value-added services, such as connecting a couple of data points at checkout to drive down the rate of cart abandonment. He said in January that 35 million merchants use PayPal and \"when we improve their conversion rate, it improves their business, it improves our bottom line.\" PayPal noted to shareholders in its latest earnings report that its branded checkout, along with Braintree and Venmo, helped the company achieve its highest growth rate in transaction margin dollars  since 2021 . Overall transaction margin dollars increased 8% to $3.6 billion. Susquehanna's Friedman says a career at Intuit is the perfect training ground for learning how to mastermind a stock recovery. Speaking to executives there is like \"talking to a dashboard,\" he said. \"The source code to engineer a higher stock is profitability,\" Friedman said. Chriss \"really boils down his management style to the things that count\" and \"reducing what's irrelevant,\" he added. With Venmo, the goal is to turn one of the most popular choices for money transfer from a strictly consumer app, which has no transaction fees, to a product for merchants.  DoorDash ,  Starbucks  and Ticketmaster are among businesses  now accepting Venmo  as one way that consumers can pay. Getting competitive at the point of sale is another big priority. That's led PayPal to Will Ferrell. The company  launched a national campaign  last month for PayPal Everywhere, offering 5% cash back for using a PayPal debit card within the mobile app. Ferrell, the pitchman, can be seen in a  commercial  using the PayPal app to buy lemonade and gas, while singing a parody of Fleetwood Mac's \"Everywhere.\" Stalder says PayPal is way behind Apple and  Google , which own the dominant smartphone operating systems with their own embedded digital wallets. \"PayPal has been stuck because it's less convenient than the mobile wallets, No. 1,\" Stalder said. \"And No. 2, it hasn't worked offline.\" But Stalder sees a real opportunity for PayPal, in part because Apple has just  opened the Secure Element  on iOS so that other developers can more easily use the phone for contactless payments, putting them on a more equal plane with Apple Pay. That development allows PayPal to \"ride the mobile wallet rails for the first time and make some real headway in offline payments,\" Stalder said. PayPal's other point-of-sale effort is called  Fastlane , a one-click payment option for online sales that can go head-to-head with Apple Pay and Shop Pay by  Shopify . In August, fintech platform  Adyen  made Fastlane  available to businesses  in the U.S., and said it plans to expand the offering globally in the future. Chriss told investors on the earnings call that the company is urgently pushing to meet the holiday rush. \"We need to get it on as many platforms as we can so that small businesses in particular can just one-click a button and turn it on for the holidays,\" Chriss said. \"We're working with many of our large enterprises who want access to this before the holidays as well.\" Chriss' long history at Intuit gave him an intimate understanding of the expansive world of small- and medium-sized businesses. That experience could be crucial as PayPal targets SMBs with its various payment and checkout options. Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at KBW, said going further down market allows PayPal to command better economics because there's so much more competition when going after enterprises. \"To the extent that they can broaden their reach there, I think that could be quite lucrative,\" said Sakhrani, who has a buy rating on the stock. Chriss calls SMBs an \"untapped opportunity for us,\" adding on the earnings call that those companies don't want to \"piece together 17 different solutions.\" \"Small businesses are  they're fighting for every customer,\" Chriss said in July. \"They need to be able to find customers. They need to be able to engage with customers, convert them, and then reengage with them.\" Venture capitalist Oren Zeev has seen Chriss work with small businesses in another capacity. They served together on the board of home design startup  Houzz , whose customers include a lot of architects and contractors. \"He obviously brought a lot to the table with his vast experience with small businesses,\" Zeev said. As a communicator, Zeev described Chriss as \"no drama\" and \"respected by everyone.\" While he's quickly captured the respect of investors, who have lifted PayPal's market cap by over $20 billion in the year since Chriss started, there's a lot more to do. The stock remains about 75% below its record high. Sakhrani says shareholders are \"anxiously awaiting his multiple-year outlook\" as opposed to just \"trying to fix some of the stuff that was broken.\" \"There's going to be some pressure at some point in time, in the near future, for more definition around that,\" Sakhrani said. Chriss, for his part, isn't declaring victory. \"Our teams are moving with urgency, excited about our innovation and focused on execution,\" he said on the second-quarter earnings call. \"We are still early in our transformation and while pleased with our progress in many areas, we know there is much more we can do and with greater speed.\" WATCH:   PayPal's crypto lead on allowing merchants to buy and sell virtual assets"

The serviceis mostly associated with online shopping,which currently accounts for about5% of the globale-commercemarket, according to Klarna. Targeting consumers in-store has become an increasingly important priority as Klarna and other firms in the sector such as  Block 's Afterpay, Affirm, Zip, Sezzle, and Zilch seek to expand their reach. The move expands on a previous arrangement Klarna had in place with Adyen on e-commerce payments. \"We want consumers to be able to pay with Klarna at any checkout, anywhere,\" David Sykes, chief commercial officer at Klarna, said in a statement Thursday. \"Our strong partnership with Adyen gives a massive boost to our ambition to bring flexible payments to the high street in a new way.\" Adyen's head of EMEA, Alexa von Bismarck, said the deal was about giving consumers flexibility at checkout, adding that \"consumers care deeply about the in-store touch point and value brands which can allow them to pay how they want.\" Earlier this year, Klarna sold Klarna Checkout, the company's online checkout solution for merchants. This saw the firm compete less directly with payment gateways including the likes of Adyen, Stripe, and Checkout.com. Klarna's deal with Adyen comes as the Swedish tech giant is exploring a much-anticipated initial public offering. Klarna hasn't yet set a fixed timeline on when it expects to go public, however the firm's CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski  told CNBC earlier this year  that a 2024 IPO for the business wouldn't be \"impossible.\" In August, Klarna began  rolling out a checking account-like product , called Klarna balance, as well as cashback rewards in a bid to convince consumers to move more of their financial lives over to its platform. BNPL has faced criticisms from consumer rights campaigners, however, over fears it promotes the idea of consumers spending more than they can afford. Regulators are pushing for rules to bring the nascent  but fast-growing  payment method into regulation. The recently elected U.K. Labour government is expected to  set out plans for buy now, pay later  regulation soon. City Minister Tulip Siddiq said in July that the government would establish new proposals \"shortly\" after multiples delays to the previous Conservative government's regulation plans for BNPL."

        "header": "Caroline Ellison could face no jail time for role in FTX collapse",
        "content": "Caroline Ellison  was the star witness in the criminal case against disgraced  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. On Tuesday, she will face her own sentencing. Ellison's role in the implosion of the crypto empire run by her former boss and ex-boyfriend  Sam Bankman-Fried  was to lie to investors, help steal billions of dollars from FTX customers, and subsequently repurpose those funds toward bets and debts accrued at Alameda Research, the digital asset hedge fund she helmed as CEO. Bankman-Fried and Ellison are both, in the eyes of the U.S. judicial system, guilty of the same crimes. Two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Those charges carry a statutory maximum sentence of around 110 years, but there's a sliding scale that takes into account the scope of the crimes and the criminal history of the defendant. CNBC spoke to former federal prosecutors, trial attorneys and legal experts to get their take on what may be in store for Ellison at Tuesday's hearing. They agree that Ellison is likely to walk away without any jail time at all. After a jury of 12  unanimously found Bankman-Fried guilty  of all seven criminal charges against him in November, he was sentenced in March to 25 years for his crypto fraud and ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture. Unlike Bankman-Fried, Ellison  agreed to a plea deal in December 2022 . She  pleaded guilty to all charges against her and spent two years cooperating with the government, regulators and the FTX bankruptcy estate. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried continues to deny virtually all criminal wrongdoing and is  attempting  to get his case retried. Lawyers for Ellison and Bankman-Fried did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cooperation with the prosecution in white-collar crimes, even in what has been billed as  \"one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\"  goes a long way. Ellison was the most important of the several insiders who testified for the government, said former Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin J. O'Brien, who specializes in white-collar criminal defense in New York. \"Because of the closeness of her relationship to Sam, she was able to provide a personal portrait of Bankman-Fried, an elusive character to be sure, that was probably unique in the government's case,\" O'Brien said. The federal Probation Department has recommended \"time served with three years of supervised release\" as a credit to Ellison's \"extraordinary cooperation with the government\" and \"her otherwise unblemished record.\" While District Judge Lewis Kaplan is under no obligation to accept the Probation Department's recommendation, O'Brien said that, along with some sort of fine, that would be \"a fair sentence\" because it reflects the \"enormous value\" of Ellison's cooperation. The U.S. legal system tends to favor reduced sentences for those who assist in bringing down higher targets, said Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. At most, Perry estimates that Ellison, who is the third executive tied to Bankman-Fried's enterprise to be sentenced, faces 18 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Though Ellison was deeply involved in the fraudulent activities, \"she did not have the same control or directorial authority as SBF, which will likely influence the judge's decision about imposing a light sentence,\" Perry said. More than likely, Ellison's conviction will entail several years of supervised release and community service with a slew of attached activity restrictions, such as no trading in both crypto and noncrypto markets or foreign travel, said Yesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University. Unlike Bankman-Fried who has faced public admonition and been portrayed by the government as a recidivist character, Ellison has been praised repeatedly by prosecutors and by new FTX CEO and bankruptcy administrator John Ray III. \"On the stand, she came across as someone who felt guilt and pain at what she had done,\" Yadav said. SBF's defense team asked for  no more than 6 years  of incarceration, but Kaplan said Ellison's testimony ultimately proved pivotal to his decision to sentence Bankman-Fried to nearly four times that. Kaplan also sided with federal prosecutors when he revoked Bankman-Fried's bail and sent him back to jail for witness tampering after he leaked private diary entries written by Ellison. Kaplan described the leak by Bankman-Fried as one designed to  \"hurt\" and \"discredit\" Ellison. Ellison \"suffered very public humiliation over the last two years, often with sexist overtones,\" Yadav said. Most judges don't like sending people to jail who aren't a threat to harm others in the future, said former federal prosecutor Paul Tuchmann. \"The chance of Ellison ever harming anyone through criminal conduct in the future again are very low,\" Tuchmann said. If Kaplan ends up forgoing jail time in Ellison's sentence, that could bode well for former FTX engineering chief  Nishad Singh  and  Gary Wang , the co-founder and chief technology officer of FTX. Singh and Wang will be sentenced Oct. 30 and Nov. 20, respectively. \"I do think that if he wants to, Judge Kaplan can 'afford' to give all of these people no prison time,\" said Tuchmann. \"Most judges want to encourage people like that to cooperate, and a sentence of time served and probation is the best way to do that.\" WATCH:  Sam Bankman-Fried's family on sentencing: We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son"

        "header": "New details of Trump family crypto project released, including who can buy in ",
        "content": "More than two hours intoRepublican former President  Donald Trump s World Liberty Financial launch event on X Monday night,the team behind the Trump familys new crypto project finally unveiled a key detail: Who can buy the forthcoming tokens it plans to release, and how shares of the project will be allotted. For over a month , the former president and his family have been pumping up the endeavor with vague descriptions, promising that it will do many things at once. Lofty goals set by those involved in the project on Monday nights X space suggest that World Liberty Financial will be a sort of crypto banking platform,where the general public will be encouraged to borrow, lend and invest in crypto. There will also be an accompanying token called WLFI, founders said Monday. The equity structure for these tokens will be that 20% of the projects tokens are allotted to the founding team, which includes the Trumps, 17% of tokens are set aside for user rewards, and the remaining 63% of the coins will be made available for the public to purchase, said founder Zak Folkman. There will be no pre-sales or early buy ins, Folkman added.  An earlier leaked draft of an internal project outline had the founders share at 70%, sparking concerns that the project would be little more than a get-rich-quick scheme. The token will be a Reg D token offering, which follows the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation D  a provision that makes it possible for a company to raise capital without first registering their securities with the commission so long as certain conditions are met. These were themes that Trump covered in a conversation format early on in the more than two hour event, as he spoke about the perceived hostility of the Securities and Exchange Commission towards the digital currency industry.  Several high profile figures in the industry take issue with SEC Chair Gary Gensler, claiming that he is regulating the industry through enforcement actions, rather than via rules. Over the course of Trumps 40-minute fireside chat at the top of the more than two hour livestream, he talked about how he wasnt overly interested in crypto initially.  But that changed, he said, when sales of his Trump trademarked nonfungible token collections were paid for with crypto. I think my children opened my eyes more than anything else. Crypto is one of those things we have to do, Trumpsaid near the end of his remarks. Whether we like it or not, we have to do it. Mondays event came at an unprecedented moment for Trumps presidential campaign. On Sunday afternoon  at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump and his longtime friend and political donor, Steve Witkoff, were  between the fifth and sixth holes on the course  when gunshots were fired. The FBI has characterized the incident as an apparent assassination attempt on the former president. Witkoff is a longtime friend of Trumps. Hes also part of the small group of World Liberty Financial founders. Witkoff was seated to Trumps right during Monday nights livestream, and described how he brought the Trump family together with two crypto entrepreneurs to get the project started. My son introduced me to two partners, Chase Herro and Zak Folkman, who are exceptionally bright people ...These guys are as smart as any currency traders Ive ever met. And they began talking to me about decentralized finance, which means frictionless finance, and why it made sense for people. And about the forgotten, who cant get credit out there, Witkoff said. As I began to understand that, I said, Who would understand this better than the Trump family? And we had a meeting initially with Eric, Don Jr., and the president and his counsel. And we said, Lets go pursue it. Weve been on it for close to nine months, said Witkoff. As Witkoff spoke, the parallels between World Liberty Financial and Trumps other recent venture,  Trump Media & Technology Group , were inescapable. In Trump Medias case, two former cast members from Trumps NBC hit reality show The Apprentice  approached Trump in 2021  with an idea for a new, conservative social media platform.  Three and a half years later, Trump Medias publicly traded stock has boosted Trumps net worth by billions of dollars, and Truth Social is his social platform of choice. Alongside Trump and Witkoff, founders of World Liberty Financial include Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Barron Trump, as well as Witkoffs son, Zach Witkoff. A copy of an early internal report, known as a white paper and  obtained by CoinDesk , listed Barron as Chief DeFi Visionary, Eric and Donald Jr. as Web3 Ambassadors, and Trump Sr. as Chief Crypto Advocate. But while the Trumps will receive compensation from the project, the platform itself is not owned, managed, operated or sold by members of the Trump family. Witkoff, a real estate investor, and Eric Trump,  executive vice president  of the Trump Organization, are the two people calling the shots at World Liberty Financial, according to a person familiar with the project. Both are new to the crypto industry. Until Monday, much of what the public knew about World Liberty was based on interviews Trumps sons had given to the press over the past month, as well as a leaked white paper that served as a sort of crypto project manifesto, and conversations with insiders. Anyone who wanted material details of the platform, including the white paper, was asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement, according to a person familiar with the project. World Liberty Financial represents the latest step in Donald Trumps evolving political and personal relationship with the crypto industry.  Some visible figures in crypto have cozied up to Trump during the 2024 election cycle, lending their cash and endorsements to the Republican nominee for president.  At the same time, Trump has  adopted increasingly bullish talking points  about crypto on the campaign trail. This culminated in his  delivery of a keynote address  in July at the  biggest bitcoin event  of the year in Nashville, Tennessee. Some of these supporters however, have also said they are concerned that Trumps foray into crypto himself could jeopardize his rapport with the sector more broadly, especially if the launch doesnt go as planned. Founders offered scant details on Monday about any future timelines for the project, saying only that new information will be shared on official social media channels, and warning fans not to fall for scams.

        "header": "FDIC unveils rule forcing banks to keep fintech customer data in aftermath of Synapse debacle",
        "content": "The  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  on Tuesday proposed a new rule forcing banks to keep detailed records for customers of fintech apps after the failure of tech firm Synapse resulted in thousands of Americans being  locked out  of their accounts. The rule, aimed at accounts opened by fintech firms that partner with banks, would make the institution maintain records of who owns it and the daily balances attributed to the owner, according to an FDIC memo. Fintech apps often lean on a practice where many customers' funds are pooled into a  single large account  at a bank, which relies on either the fintech or a third party to maintain ledgers of transactions and ownership. That situation exposed customers to the risk that the nonbanks involved would keep shoddy or incomplete records, making it hard to determine who to pay out in the event of a failure. That's what happened in the Synapse collapse, which impacted more than 100,000 users of fintech apps including  Yotta  and Juno. Customers with funds in these \"for benefit of\" accounts have been unable to access their money since May. \"In many cases, it was advertised that the funds were FDIC-insured, and consumers may have believed that their funds would remain safe and accessible due to representations made regarding placement of those funds in\" FDIC-member banks, the regulator said in its memo. Keeping better records would allow the FDIC to quickly pay depositors in the event of a bank failure by helping to satisfy conditions needed for \"pass-through insurance,\" FDIC officials said Tuesday in a briefing. While FDIC insurance doesn't get paid out in the event the fintech provider fails, like in the Synapse situation, enhanced records would help a bankruptcy court determine who is owed what, the officials added. If approved by the FDIC board of governors in a vote Tuesday, the rule will get published in the Federal Register for a 60-day comment period. Separately, the FDIC also released a statement on its policy on bank mergers, which would heighten scrutiny of the impacts of consolidation, especially for deals creating banks with more than $100 billion in assets. Bank mergers slowed under the Biden administration, drawing criticism from industry analysts who say that consolidation would create more robust competitors for the likes of megabanks including  JPMorgan Chase ."

        "header": "Crypto spending on 2024 election hits $190 million, led by Winklevoss twins",
        "content": "Cameron  and  Tyler  Winklevoss are the biggest individual crypto donors this election cycle,   giving a combined $10.1 million, or slightly over $5 million each, according to Federal Election Commission data compiled by crypto market and blockchain analyst James Delmore and independently verified by CNBC. With 50 days to go until the November general election, political donations from, or in support of, the crypto industry are up to around $190 million, as some of the biggest names in the sector open their digital wallets to help elect candidates sympathetic to their interests. The Winklevoss twins gave around $1.7 million combined in  bitcoin  to the Trump 47 Committee,   which raises money for Republican former  President Donald Trump , over $700,000 combined to the pro-Trump Make America Great Again PAC, $250,000 each to the pro-Trump America PAC, and $4.9 million to the bipartisan pro-crypto Fairshake PAC. Top executives from blockchain giant Ripple Labs have collectively given more than $3 million to candidate committees and super PACs so far this cycle, with co-founder  Chris Larsen  donating nearly $2.4 million of that,   mostly to help Democratic candidates. Ripple CEO  Brad Garlinghouse  has donated more than $384,000 to multiple PACs and candidates, including to Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and John Deaton, a Republican running against  Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren  in Massachusetts. The company's chief legal officer,  Stuart Alderoty , gave $300,000 to the Trump 47 Committee. At a fundraiser  for Trump in June, Alderoty  explained how Ripple  had spent over $100 million litigation to defend itself against civil charges brought by the SEC. The event was held at the San Francisco mansion of venture capitalist  David Sacks . The Winklevoss twins and Coinbase didn't respond to requests for comment. Ripple referred CNBC to prior comments from executives, including a June  post  from Garlinghouse on X, where he wrote that \"candidates will only gain votes for being pro-crypto, and absolutely lose them for being anti-crypto.\" The month after the San Francisco fundraiser,  Trump promised  to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler if he were elected, even though U.S. presidents do not have the authority to fire members of independent commissions without cause. While the incoming president could unseat Gensler from his position as chairman, he would remain on as a commissioner until the end of his term. Under Gensler, the SEC has taken on major industry players, including   centralized cryptocurrency exchanges  Kraken  and  Coinbase . Executives from the two companies have been spending big this cycle.  Coinbase  CEO  Brian Armstrong   has given over $1.3 million to a mix of PACs including Fairshake and JD Vance for Senate Inc., as well as directly to Democrats and Republicans running for both House and Senate seats. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has attended at least two Trump fundraisers,  including one in Nashville  on the sidelines of the biggest bitcoin event of the year. Kraken co-founder and Chairman  Jesse Powell  has donated just over $1 million to the Trump campaign. Individual crypto contributors include ex-Bitfinex strategy chief  Phil Potter   (over $1.6 million),   Multicoin Capital's  Kyle Samani  ($878,600), Paradigm co-founder  Fred Ehrsam  ($735,400), Union Square Ventures partner  Fred Wilson  ($1,4 million), Paxos CEO and co-founder  Charles Cascarilla  ($198,500),   BitGo CEO  Mike Belshe  ($119,825),   Solana co-founder  Anatoly Yakavenko  ($67,100), and Gibraltar-based Xapo Bank founder  Wences Casares  ($374,899). According to  Delmore's report , no known donations have been made in cryptocurrency to the Future Forward PAC, which is raising funds for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president. Future Forward began accepting crypto donations this month through a partnership with Coinbase Commerce. It appears the donation page on the website still doesn't offer a crypto option. CNBC reached out to two representatives from Future Forward listed on the PAC's FEC filing to ask about the tally of crypto donations thus far and when it plans to add a crypto payment option on its website. They didn't immediately respond. Harris' fundraising operation has taken off since President Biden dropped out of the race, with her campaign  raising $47 million in the first 24 hours  after her first, and perhaps only, debate against Trump  on Tuesday . Delmore, who has been assembling reports on crypto donations in the 2024 election for blockchain analytics platform Breadcrumbs, told CNBC that industry spending is nearly double where it was in the mid-terms  more than $190 million in the 2024 election versus  $98 million in the 2022 election . It's nearly 13 times spending in 2020 of $15 million  a figure based on a mix of data from FEC and OpenSecrets filings. Unlike the past two election cycles, which featured spending from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and founder Sam Bankman-Fried, this year's contributor list is more robust and diverse. Bankman-Fried was  sentenced to 25 years  in prison in March for stealing $8 billion worth of customer money through FTX. \"Most of the crypto donations in 2022 were from FTX and SBF and almost all of them went to Democrats or PACs that support Democrats,\" Delmore said. Delmore said that spending is more balanced between the two parties, but \"more has definitely gone to Republican candidates and PACs that supported Republicans and opposed Democrats.\" A Public Citizen  report last month  found that nearly half of all the corporate money flowing into this year's election has come from the crypto industry, with Coinbase and Ripple leading the pack. There is a lot of overlap between crypto's biggest corporate and individual spenders. The majority of funds for Fairshake, one of the top-spending PACs this year, can be traced to four sources: Coinbase, Ripple, Jump Crypto and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. Widening the category to all of crypto, Delmore's research finds that billions of dollars are at play, including more than $20 million in sales generated by non-fungible tokens (NFT) released by Trump,  according to Bloomberg reporting , Trump-branded meme tokens, the $190 million in political donations from or in support of crypto, and another $1.1 billion on betting on the platform Polymarket. So far, $922 million in  bets  have been placedon who will be the winner of the election, and another $206 million on who will win the popular vote . Electing pro-crypto candidates ultimately comes down to turning out the vote. The Stand With Crypto Alliance , launched by Coinbase last year, is in the midst of a cross-country bus tour through battleground states to get people registered to vote. The campaign culminates in an event on DC on Wednesday that will include speeches by members of Coinbase's C-suite, as well as a live performance by music duo The Chainsmokers.

        "header": "FTX fraudster Caroline Ellison sentenced to 2 years in prison, ordered to forfeit $11 billion",
        "content": "Caroline Ellison , the star witness in the prosecution of her former boyfriend, FTX founder  Sam Bankman-Fried ,was sentenced Tuesday in New York federal court to two years in prison and ordered to forfeit $11 billion for her role in the massive  fraud  and conspiracy that doomed the  cryptocurrency exchange  once valued at $32 billion. The prison term was significantly stiffer than the recommendation by the federal Probation Department that  Judge Lewis Kaplan  sentence Ellison, who had run the hedge fund  Alameda Research , to three years of supervised release, with no time at all behind bars. Defense lawyers also had requested a no-prison sentence for Ellison. Alameda received much of the $8 billion in customer funds looted by Bankman-Fried from FTX. The stolen money was used for Alameda's trading operation and other purposes. While Kaplan praised Ellison, 29, for her extensive cooperation with prosecutors  which led to the  conviction  of Bankman-Fried  the judge said her criminal sentence needed to deter other potential bad actors from committing fraud. The judge said the FTX case is probably the greatest financial fraud perpetrated in the history of the U.S., and because of that a \"literal get-out-of-jail-free card I can't agree to,\" Kaplan said in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where Ellison's parents and two sisters looked on from the courtroom's gallery. \"I've seen a lot of cooperators over the years and I've never seen one quite like Miss Ellison,\" said Kaplan, who also said he believed that Ellison was genuinely remorseful for her crimes and that her cooperation carried a steep price for her emotionally. Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon urged Kaplan for leniency, citing Ellison's consistent truthfulness while refusing to minimize her role in the fraud. Sassoon also said she could not overstate Ellison's assistance in convicting Bankman-Fried. Ellison's attorney, Anjan Sahni, urged the judge to give Ellison a second chance saying she has \"recovered her moral compass\" and \"profoundly regrets\" not leaving FTX and Bankman-Fried's orbit. Ellison read from a statement in a shaky voice while crying at times as she apologized to the people she had hurt and said she was deeply ashamed. She also said she was sorry for not being brave enough to walk away from FTX and Bankman-Fried. Kaplan allowed Ellison to remain free on bail until she surrenders to prison either on or after Nov. 7. Ellison reached a  plea deal with prosecutors in December 2022 , a month after FTX spiraled into bankruptcy. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy and financial fraud charges. Bankman-Fried, in contrast, chose to stand trial and was convicted of all seven criminal fraud charges against him. He was  sentenced to 25 years  in prison in March and also was ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture by Kaplan. Bankman-Fried since then has appealed his conviction, and requested a new trial and a different judge, arguing that Kaplan was biased against him. Two other former FTX executives, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, are scheduled to be sentenced later this year. Like Ellison, they pleaded guilty instead of standing trial. On Tuesday, before sentencing Ellison, Kaplan noted that while the FTX founder had denied criminal conduct, she cooperated with authorities. \"It didn't work out so well\" for Bankman-Fried, in part because of Ellison's cooperation, the judge said. Kaplan credited Ellison for providing prosecutors with seven fake spreadsheets, which he called \"one of the huge pieces of evidence in the case\" against Bankman-Fried. Late Monday, Ellison's attorneys in a court filing said they had finalized financial settlements with prosecutors and the FTX debtor's estate. The filing did not say how much she would pay in those settlements, which are separate from the forfeiture order, but it was already known that Ellison's $10 million in shares in the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, which have grown substantially since she first bought them, provide the bulk value of her settlements. Both Bankman-Fried and Ellison had faced the same statutory maximum sentence of about 110 years in prison for their crimes. Defendants in criminal cases who cooperate with prosecutors instead of fighting the charges, particularly in white-collar cases such as FTX, often receive leniency when they are sentenced.

        "header": "Bitcoin network hits record level of power, but falling profits push miners to AI",
        "content": "Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET It was a week of extremes for  bitcoin  enthusiasts.  On the plus side, the cryptocurrency rose 12% in the past seven days and the network hash ratehit an all-time high. Hash rate refers to the collective computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network, and the recent high suggests there have never been more miners online, actively securing the network. At the same time, another key metric this week showed it's increasingly difficult to make money in the mining business. Investment bank Jefferies wrote in a report that crypto mining was \"significantly\" less profitable in August. The average daily revenue per exahash, or income per miner, fell by 11.8% from the prior month, Jefferies said.  As bitcoin becomes more of an established, and even mainstream part of the economy, the days of easy money appear to be in the rearview mirror. Institutional capital has  poured in  since the SEC approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, and the bitcoin network is more robust than ever, held together by a vast and decentralized network of miners securing transactions with the help of large banks of machines. But more people  and their powerful machines  are vying for smaller rewards. In April , the bitcoin code automatically cut new issuance of the world's largest cryptocurrency in half, an event that occurs roughly every four years to create scarcity. The halving historically precedes a wave of bankruptcies among bitcoin mining firms, which are suddenly generating much less revenue with the same level of operating costs.  Bitcoin miners are getting hammered by Wall Street. Marathon Digital  is down nearly 30% in 2024, while  Riot Platforms  has fallen 53%. The price of bitcoin, meanwhile, is up about 44% this year.  Jefferies said North American publicly traded mining firms minted a smaller share of new bitcoin in August compared to July, falling to 19.9% of the total network. They're still spending on equipment upgrades, meaning  efficiency is improving but economics are getting worse. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel told CNBC that, due to the upgrade cycle, machines are able to hash twice as much as previous models with the same energy use. \"No need to add sites or power, just upgrade systems,\" Thiel said. Riot CEO Jason Les is as bullish as ever on the future of bitcoin despite the challenging economic conditions. He said \"bitcoin is the most sound money in the world,\" and \"low-cost mining is an efficient way to get exposure to it.\" Not all miners are feeling the pinch. Companies like  Core Scientific , which  emerged from bankruptcy  in January, are finding ways to use their massive infrastructure to power artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC). Last month , Coreannounced an expanded deal worth $6.7 billion with CoreWeave , an Nvidia -backed startup that's providing the chipmaker's graphics processing units (GPUs) for running AI models. In a note this week, Bernstein singled out Core Scientific as the best-performing publicly traded bitcoin miner, noting that of the miners that have diversified into AI and HPC, Core is the \"only one with a material co-location contract with a leading GPU Cloud provider.\" Core has more than doubled in value since its return to the stock market and now has a market cap of close to $3 billion.  \"Our facilities were developed to be multi-use for not only just bitcoin mining, but also for the transition that we're doing right now to high-performance computing,\" Core CEO Adam Sullivan told CNBC. Bernstein added that if Core executes all of its 700 megawatt capacity that it's allocated to AI and HPC, it would make the company the third-largest data center company listed in the U.S. \"It's really about the next three years in terms of where the opportunity set truly lies to capture a large portion of the data center market,\" Sullivan said. \"Every big data center company that exists carved out a niche, just so happens that the niche that bitcoin miners are carving out now are in the largest niche that has ever been found in the data center industry.\"    CNBC's Talia Kaplan and Jordan Smith contributed to this report.

Salame now claims prosecutors promised him through his then-attorneys that they would drop a criminal probe of his romantic partner  Michelle Bond  if he pleaded guilty in his case. \"You are asking me to let stand a conviction and sentence that I now know is based on false testimony before me in the plea allocution,\" Kaplan told Salame on Thursday. \"And that might be a big problem,\" the judge told Salame, whom he previously  sentenced  to 7 years in prison, several months more than the top end of what prosecutors had requested. Kaplan repeatedly said during the hearing that Salame \"induced\" him to accept his guilty plea and was visibly annoyed at the defendant. Salame and other federal criminal defendants are required to testify truthfully during plea hearings and reveal if anyone has made promises or offers in exchange for their admission of guilt. Kaplan told Salame, his lawyers and prosecutors that he will take some time to consider what should be done. He said sanctions are possible against Salame, who had been a leader at FTX, the now-failed cryptocurrency exchange founded by convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried. Salame's lawyer declined to comment to CNBC after the hearing. The judge also said Thursday that Salame must now surrender to prison by Oct. 11 after officials realized that the prior surrender date of Oct. 13 would fall on a Sunday. Last month, lawyers for Salame asked Kaplan to void his  2023 guilty plea  by claiming that prosecutors weren't holding up their end of the agreement. Salame's attorneys alleged in  an August court filing  that the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, despite promising Salame in April 2023 that they would stop probing his domestic partner Bond for campaign finance violations if he agreed to the arrangement, had continued to investigate Bond. The defense lawyers asked Kaplan to void Salame's guilty plea on those grounds. A day after the filing, Bond  was indicted  in Manhattan federal court on campaign finance charges tied to her unsuccessful run for Congress in 2022. Prosecutors accused her of conspiring to raise unlawful campaign contributions from FTX. The indictment alleges Salame conspired with Bond to commit the crimes, saying he arranged the payment from FTX to Bond. Salame allegedly wired hundreds of thousands of dollars to Bond's personal bank account between June and August 2022, which she put toward illegally funding her campaign, according to the indictment. Days after Bond was charged, Salame filed a motion seeking to drop his bid to vacate his guilty plea. Kaplan then ordered him to appear for Thursday's hearing to review his allegations. Salame reiterated during the hearing that he is no longer seeking to void his guilty plea. WATCH:   Bankman-Fried sentenced"

The number suggests that the company has created 17% more value for shareholders by selling stock to buy bitcoin. \"We're basically giving people different types of bitcoin exposure,\" Saylor told CNBC in an interview this week. \"MicroStrategy's mission is to securitize bitcoin and serve as the institutional bridge between traditional, mainstream investors and bitcoin.\" Even after this week's rally, MicroStrategy shares are about 26% off their March high. The stock closed Friday at $141.47. But MicroStrategy is far outperforming bitcoin, which is up 35% for the year. Saylor said owning MicroStrategy is a way to invest in bitcoin but with a variety of attributes, such as increased leverage or downside protection. \"A lot of people, they don't want to own or they can't own bitcoin,\" Saylor said.

        "header": "Dutch neobank Bunq goes on hiring spree, targeting digital nomads, as other fintechs slash jobs",
        "content": "Dutch challenger bank Bunq told CNBC that it plans to grow its global headcount by 70% this year to over 700 employees, even as other financial technology startups have decided to cut jobs. Bunq, which operates in markets across the European Union, is looking to expand into new regions including the U.K. and the United States, taking on the fintechs already in those countries, including the likes of Britain's Monzo and Revolut, and American neobank Chime. Bunq said it needs corresponding talent in those regions to support its global expansion ambitions. To that end, the firm said it plans to see out the year with 735 employees globally  up 72% from its 427 members of staff at the start of 2024. \"Bunq focusses on digital nomads who tend to roam the world,\" Ali Niknam, Bunq's CEO and co-founder, told CNBC via emailed comments. So-called \"digital nomads\" are defined as people who travel freely whileworking remotely, using technology and the internet to work abroad from hotels, cafes,libraries, co-working spaces, or temporary housing. \"We'd love to be able to service our users wherever they go  given the regulatory environment we're in, this results in us having to have a lot of extra people to make this happen,\" Niknam added. Bunq is currently in the process of applying for banking licenses in both the U.S. and U.K. Last year, the firm submitted an application for a federal banking license. And in the U.K., Bunq is awaiting a decision from financial regulators on an application to become a licensed e-money institution, or EMI. The digital bank said it was actively looking to hire across sales and business development, product marketing, PR, affiliate marketing, and market analysis, as well as user support, development, and quality assurance. Many of these positions will be part of a \"tailored digital nomad\" program that allows staff to work from anywhere in the world, Bunq said. However, the firm stressed it's not closing down office space and that many new hires would work in its offices, including in Amsterdam, Sofia, Istanbul, Munich, Paris, Dublin, Madrid, London, and New York City. Over the past two years, one of thebiggest stories in both the fintech and broader technology industryhas been companies slashing jobs to cut back on the massive spending implemented during in the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. The operating environment for fintech firms has gotten tougher, meanwhile, with inflation knocking consumer confidence and higher interest rates making it harder for startups to raise money. In January last year, cryptocurrency exchange  Coinbase   slashed 950 jobs . It was followed by payments giant  PayPal , which  reduced its global headcount by 2,000 people  in early 2023, and then by another  2,500 jobs  in early 2024. Meanwhile, some fintechs are looking to artificial intelligence to take on a growing number of roles. Swedish buy now, pay later firm Klarna, for instance, said last month that it was able to reduce its workforce from 5,000 to 3,800 over the past year from attrition alone. It added that it is looking to further cut employee numbers down to 2,000 through the use of AI in marketing and customer service. \"Our proven scale efficiencies have been enhanced by our investment in AI, which has driven down operating expenses and improved gross profits,\" the company said in  first-half earnings . Klarna said that its average revenue per employee had risen 73% year-over-year, thanks in no small part to the internal application of AI. Bunq's Niknam said he doesn't see AI as a way to help firms reduce headcount, however. \"We've been deploying AI systems and solutions years before they became mainstream, [but] in our experience AI empowers our employees to be able to do better by our users, more effectively and efficiently,\" he told CNBC. Bunq earlier this year reported its first full year of profitability, generating 53.1 million euros ($58.51 million) in net profit in 2023. The business was last valued privately by investors at 1.65 billion euros."

        "content": "A big purple bus adorned with \"AMERICA  CRYPTO\" started making its way across five swing states last week, on a mission to get out the vote ahead of the presidential election. The campaign, initially launched by  Coinbase , has a shorter-term objective: Getting a crypto question asked at Tuesday night's  presidential debate . The  Stand With Crypto Alliance , created last year,  initiated a letter writing petition  five days ago to pressure ABC News to raise a crypto question in the first  and perhaps only  presidential debate between  Donald Trump  and  Vice President Kamala Harris . The group, which is hosting 2,500 debate watch parties across the country, has gotten over 2,000 people to sign a pre-drafted letter on its website. \"I am one of the 52 million Americans who own cryptocurrency,\" the letter says. \"On behalf of myself and all American crypto owners, I urge you to ask the candidates their position on cryptocurrency and its place in the American economy.\" In recent months , Trump has  branded himself  as the  pro-crypto candidate . Harris hasn't yet made her official stance known on digital assets, but the Biden administration's aggressive crackdown on the industry has created an opening for the former president. Trump has pledged to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who's taken on companies including Coinbase. In addition to the presidential race, the group is backing crypto-friendly politicians in Congress as it pursues more favorable laws. In May, the House passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act , with the help of more than 70 Democrats. \"Bipartisan crypto legislation has already passed the House of Representatives, and more and more elected officials are coming out in support of crypto,\" the letter says. ABC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. On its website, the alliance gives Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, \"A\" grades for their support of crypto. For Harris and running mate Tim Walz, governor of Minnesota, the group gives a grade of \"N/A\" and says, \"pending stance on crypto.\" Many crypto fanatics see the November election as a defining moment for the sector, and they're showing up with their wallets.  Nearly half of all donations  made by corporations this cycle have been from crypto companies, according to a Public Citizen report. Stand With Crypto's tour through battleground states is more about turning out the vote than raising cash. And the group has been trying for months to get presidential candidates to talk about the issue. The alliance previously lobbied CNN with 2,300 emails asking for a crypto-pegged question ahead of the June  debate  between Trump and President Joe Biden, who at the time was the presumptive Democratic nominee. The network didn't broach the topic. Between online and in-person efforts, Stand with Crypto has signed up 104,000 people through its voter registration tool. Along the way, the group has put on concerts and delivered speeches to throngs of fans. The bus tour kicked off in Phoenix last Wednesday, with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democrat who's now an independent, stoking the crowd with an impassioned speech about electing lawmakers who understand cryptocurrencies. \"Sensible, reasonable regulation that allows the industry to continue to innovate and grow  that's what we got to stay focused on,\" Sinema said. The bus then headed to Las Vegas, where crypto advocates heard from the state treasurer and chief of staff for the lieutenant governor. According to data shared by the alliance, 385,000 Nevadans are crypto owners, and more than 16,000 people in the state have signed up to be Stand with Crypto advocates. Arizona and Nevada are two of the seven states considered critical and up for grabs with less than two months until election day and the contest in a virtual tie. This week, the crypto bus will make stops in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which are also among the key swing states. The final event takes place in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 18. Several top Coinbase execs, including Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, will speak, and music duo The Chainsmokers will be performing at a nightclub. The movement hasn't entirely committed to Trump. Coinbase policy head Faryar Shirzad, who will also be speaking in D.C., said  on X that he's been \"pleased to take part in a number of discussions with the Harris team.\" He described the approach as \"constructive\" and said \"the dialogue had been an important first step.\" Though Harris hasn't formally come out with her campaign position on crypto, members of her team have been meeting with crypto industry leaders for months. \"I think we're going to hear from Vice President Harris soon on this,\" Democratic Rep. Wiley Nickel of North Carolina told CNBC in an interview  in July  on the sidelines of the biggest bitcoin event of the year in Nashville. \"And I'm very optimistic we're gonna get a reset. And that, I think, will matter in a major way.\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., also told CNBC at the time that he had been in dialogue with the Harris team on the issue. Democrats have since gotten more vocal. At a virtual town hall in August, Senate Majority Leader  Chuck Schumer said  a crypto bill could pass his chamber this year.

        "header": "Caroline Ellison seeks to duck prison sentence for role in FTX collapse",
        "content": "Lawyers for Caroline Ellison, the star witness in the prosecution of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, are recommending no prison time for their client's role in the implosion of the crypto empire that was run by her former boss and ex-boyfriend. In a court filing  Tuesday night, the attorneys said that, at most, Ellison should be sentenced to time served and supervised release because of her swift return to the U.S. from FTX's Bahamas headquarters in 2022 and her choice to voluntarily cooperate with the U.S. attorney's office and financial regulators in helping them understand what went wrong at FTX and sister hedge fund Alameda Research. Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over Bankman-Fried's case,  cited Ellison's testimony  when he decided in March to sentence the FTX founder to  25 years behind bars . Ellison, who ran Alameda Research, agreed to a plea deal in December 2022 , a month after FTX spiraled into bankruptcy. Unlike Bankman-Fried, who was  convicted of all seven  criminal fraud charges against him,  Ellison pleaded guilty  to conspiracy and financial fraud charges, rather than go to trial. The Tuesday filing also refers to the recommendation of the court's Probation Department that Ellison be given a sentence of \"time served with three years of supervised release\" as a credit to her \"extraordinary cooperation with the government\" and \"her otherwise unblemished record.\" Lawyers added that the department's presentence report, which referenced numerous character testimonials speaking to Ellison's ethics and integrity, also recommended that she not be fined. \"Caroline poses no risk of recidivism and presents no threat to public safety,\" the filing says. \"It would therefore promote respect for the law to grant leniency in recognition of Caroline's early disclosure of the crimes, her unmitigated acceptance of responsibility for them, and  most importantly  her extensive cooperation with the government.\" In the filing, FTX CEO John Ray, who has been guiding the crypto firm through bankruptcy proceedings, describes Ellison's cooperation as \"valuable\" in helping his team protect and preserve \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" in assets. He added that she has worked with his advisors to provide information regarding private keys to cryptocurrency wallets that contain \"estate assets, DeFi positions, FTX exchange internal account information, the use of third-party exchanges for pre-petition trading, and pre-petition auditing practices.\" The 67-page document describe large swaths of Ellison's life, starting from her earliest days in Boston and stretching into her protracted and troubled romance with Bankman-Fried. In that time, she \"moved around the globe at his direction, first to Hong Kong and later the Bahamas,\" and \"worked long, stressful, Adderall-fueled hours,\" the filing says. Bankman-Fried forced Ellison into a sort-of isolation, culminating in her moral compass being \"warped,\" the lawyers say. At his direction, Ellison helped \"steal billions,\" all while living \"in dread, knowing that a disastrous collapse was likely, but fearing that disentangling herself would only hasten that collapse.\" \"Bankman-Fried convinced her to stay, telling her she was essential to the survival of the business, and that he loved her,\" all \"while also perversely demonstrating that he considered her not good enough to be seen in public with him at high-profile events,\" the filing says. This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Looking for alternatives to Nvidia? Futurum CEO names 3 he's bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside An attorney for Bankman-Fried didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The document makes a point of noting that she has \"drawn comfort from a new partner,\" whose name is omitted from the document, but whom her friends recognize as \"supportive and a positive, grounding influence.\" She's also written a novel, that's \"unrelated to the facts of this case.\" Ellison, who turns 30 in November, has a sentencing hearing on Sept. 24, in the same courthouse where she took the stand for several days in Bankman-Fried's trial. Her former roommates and ex-FTX executives, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, will be sentenced in October and November, respectively.   CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency exchange  Coinbase  just wrapped up its worst week of the year. Bitcoin miner  Marathon Digital  tumbled 20%. A basket of crypto-related equities tracked by  Schwab  fell to its lowest level since February. The industrywide selloff reflected growing concerns about the health of the U.S. economy and tracked a broader decline in prices of  bitcoin ,  ether  and risky assets in general. The tech-heavy Nasdaq  slid 5.8%  for the week, its worst performance since January 2022. In addition to macro pressures, the calendar is doing crypto no favors. According to  CoinGlass , September is historically a difficult trading month for crypto assets, with bitcoin notching an average loss of 4.8%. The  Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a gauge of crypto market sentiment, is firmly in the \"Extreme Fear\" zone, indicating that investors are worried about price moves. Bitcoin slipped to its lowest level since February, falling 4% in the last 24 hours to around $54,000. In a week shortened by the Labor Day holiday, Tuesday saw the steepest selloff in the broader market after weak manufacturing data stoked fears of an economic slowdown.The 11 U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds had their  worst day in over four months  after the report, as more than $287 million was collectively withdrawn from the ETFs. The data was bad through the end of the week. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported  a cooldown in the labor market with August payrolls falling short of expectations. \"The recent U.S. labor market results acted as a moment of truth for risk-on assets like bitcoin, as the labor market is considered the main sector that may influence the Fed's decision to cut rates this month,\" said Leena ElDeeb, a research analyst with ETF issuer 21Shares, in an email. The total market cap of crypto is down close to 30% from its 2024 peak of $2.67 trillion, and is now at $1.9 trillion. Altcoins like Solana's  SOL  token,  XRP  and Cardano's  ADA  all dropped more than 8% in the past week. Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, plunged 12% to around $2,200. While it was a rough week for risky assets of all sorts, investors over-indexed in crypto stocks had it particularly bad. Schwab Asset Management's crypto-themed ETF ( STCE) , which includes  MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain , andCoinbase, fell 11%. Coinbase, stuck i n a court battle with the SEC  over whether the exchange engages in unregistered sales of securities, plummeted 20% to its lowest since February. MicroStrategy, the bitcoin collecting company founded by Michael Saylor, dropped 14% for the week on the heels of a 12% slide the previous week. The top bitcoin mining companies all ended the week with double-digit declines, led by  CleanSpark 's 24% plunge.  Riot Platforms  lost 17%. The downward slide is a continuation from last month. However,  JPMorgan Chase  analysts said in a note on Friday, citing TradingView estimates, that even as token and asset prices suffered dramatic drops, trading increased in August, with total average daily volumes up 8% from the previous month. As investors turn to what's coming, one big area of focus is the Federal Reserve. The central bank could cut its benchmark for the first time in four years, when it meets Sept. 17-18. Fed Chair  Jerome Powell  said last month that \"the time has come\" for interest-rate policy to adjust. Analysts anticipate either a 0.25% or 0.5% reduction from the current rate of 5.25%-5.5%. Looser monetary policy is typically a good thing for risky assets like crypto, which tend to see more investor inflows when borrowing costs drop. The latest read on inflation comes Wednesday with August's Consumer Price Index. The readout is another key metric the Fed will consider ahead of its September meeting. The U.S. presidential debate on Tuesday might also prove a price driver in the crypto markets. Republican nominee Donald Trump has  branded himself  as the pro-crypto candidate for president and recently headlined the biggest bitcoin event of the year  in Nashville . Many in the industry  see  a potential second Trump presidency as a catalyst for the industry, in part because he has vowed to remove SEC Chair  Gary Gensler , who's long been viewed as a crypto skeptic.

More than $287 million was withdrawn from the 11 U.S.-listed ETFs, the biggest day for outflows since May 1,  according to Farside Investors data . The funds hit the market in January, following a ruling by the SEC that allowed financial firms to package bitcoin into ETFs, the same way they do for stocks and bonds. Fidelity led redemptions, with investors on Tuesday selling more than $162 million worth of shares in its FBTC fund. Grayscale,  which has seen net outflows of more than $19.8 billion since converting its trust to an ETF in January , recorded outflows of $50.4 million. The fund issued by Ark 21Shares had outflows of $33.6 million, and investors sold $25 million worth of shares in Bitwise's BITB offering. Much of the initial enthusiasm surrounding bitcoin ETFs has dissipated in the last few months, following a blockbuster  debut that broke records  for the ETF market. Spot bitcoin funds now hold a total of around $52.6 billion in assets under management,  $10 billion off their peak . A large portion of the decline is due to the drop in the price of bitcoin, which reached a record at over $73,000 in March and has since slid to about $58,400. Bitcoin fell almost 3% on Tuesday, which was also a down day for equities after  weak manufacturing data  stoked fears of an economic slowdown. It was the fifth consecutive day of redemptions across the spot funds. Spot ether ETFs,  which launched in July , have also experienced a rough months. On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency plunged almost 6%, leading to outflows in the related ETFs.  JPMorgan  analysts noted that redemptions \"were entirely driven by Grayscale,\" as investors unloaded more than $52 million worth of shares in its ETHE product. Overall, flows have been tepid. Other than inflows of $4.9 million into Fidelity's spot ether product, all other funds were flat for the day. The total assets of the spot funds is down to around $6.7 billion from $10.2 billion in July.  As of the end of the second quarter, Wall Street banks and hedge funds were buyers of bitcoin ETFs. Data regarding ether ETF purchases won't show up until the next round of filings. Quarterly disclosures with the SEC showed that institutional ownership of spot bitcoin ETFs rose to 24% by the end of the quarter, according to a note from analysts at H.C. Wainwright. Goldman Sachs made its debut in the crypto ETF market in the period,  purchasing $418 million worth of bitcoin funds . Morgan Stanley  started earlier  but reduced its holdings in the latest quarter. Of the investment bank's$1.5 trillion in assets under management, it held  $189 million worth  of spot bitcoin ETFs, down from roughly $270 million in the prior period.

        "content": "Visa said it plans to launch a dedicated service for bank transfers, skipping credit cards and the traditional direct debit process. Visa, which alongside Mastercard is one of the world's largest card networks, said Thursday it plans to launch a dedicated service for account-to-account (A2A) payments in Europe next year. Users will be able set up direct debits  transactions that take funds directly from your bank account on merchants' e-commerce stores with just a few clicks. Visa said consumers will be able to monitor these payments more easily and raise any issues by clicking a button in their banking app, giving them a similar level of protection to when they use their cards. The service should help people deal with problems like unauthorized auto-renewals of subscriptions, by making it easier for people to reverse direct debit transactions and get their money back, Visa said. It won't initially apply its A2A service to things like TV streaming services, gym memberships and food boxes, Visa added, but this is planned for the future. The product will initially launch in the U.K. in early 2025, with subsequent releases in the Nordic region and elsewhere in Europe later in 2025. The problem currently is that when a consumer sets up a payment for things like utility bills or childcare, they need to fill in a direct debit form. But this offers consumers little control, as they have to share their bank details and personal information, which isn't secure, and have limited control over the payment amount. Static direct debits, for example, require advance notice of any changes to the amount taken, meaning you have to either cancel the direct debit and set up a new one or carry out a one-off transfer. With Visa A2A, consumers will be able to set up variable recurring payments (VRP), a new type of payment that allows people to make and manage recurring payments of varying amounts. \"We want to bring pay-by-bank methods into the 21st century and give consumers choice, peace of mind and a digital experience they know and love,\" Mandy Lamb, Visa's managing director for the U.K. and Ireland, said in a statement Thursday. \"That's why we are collaborating with UK banks and open banking players, bringing our technology and years of experience in the payments card market to create an open system for A2A payments to thrive.\" Visa's A2A product relies on a technology called open banking, which requires lenders to provide third-party fintechs with access to consumer banking data. Open banking  has gained popularity over the years, especially in Europe, thanks to regulatory reforms to the banking system. The technology has enabled new payment services that can link directly to consumers' bank accounts and authorize payments on their behalf provided they've got permission. In 2021, Visa  acquired Tink, an open banking service , for 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion). The deal came on the heels of an abandoned bid from Visa to buy competing open banking firm Plaid. Visa's buyout of Tink was viewed as a way for it to get ahead of the threat from emerging fintechs building products that allow consumers and merchants to avoid paying its card transaction fees. Merchants have long bemoaned Visa and Mastercard's credit and debit card fees, accusing the companies of inflating so-called interchange fees and barring them from directing people to cheaper alternatives. In March, the two companies reached a historic $30 billion settlement to reduce their interchange fees which are taken out of a merchant's bank account when a shopper uses their card to pay for something. Visa didn't share details on how it would monetize its A2A service. By giving merchants the option to bypass cards for payments, there's a risk that Visa could potentially cannibalize its own card business. For its part, Visa told CNBC it is and always has been focused on enabling the best ways for people to pay and get paid, whether that's through a card or non-card transaction."

The stock trading app, which launched in the U.K. last November after two previous attempts to enter the market, said that its new feature would enable retail investors in the U.K. to lend out any stocks they own outright in their portfolio to interested borrowers. You can think of stock lending like \"renting\" out your stocks for extra cash. It's when you allow another party  typically a financial institution  to temporarily borrow stocks that you already own. In return, you get paid a monthly fee. Institutions typically borrow stocks for trading activities, like settlements, short selling and hedging risks. The lender still retains ownership over their shares and can sell them anytime they want. And, when they do sell, they still realize any gains or losses on the stock. In Robinhood's case, shares lent out via the app are treated as collateral, with Robinhood receiving interest from borrowers and paying it out monthly to lenders. Customers can also earn cash owed on company dividend payments  typically from the person borrowing the stock, rather than the company issuing a dividend. Customers are able to sell lent stock at any time and withdraw proceeds from sales once the trades settle, Robinhood said. It is not guaranteed stocks lent out via its lending program will always be matched to an individual borrower, however. \"Stock Lending is another innovative way for our customers in the UK to put their investments to work and earn passive income,\" Jordan Sinclair, president of Robinhood U.K., said in a statement Wednesday. \"We're excited to continue to give retail customers greater access to the financial system, with the product now available in our intuitive mobile app.\" Share lending isn't unheard of in the U.K.  but it is rare. Several firms offer securities lending programs, including BlackRock, Interactive Brokers, Trading 212, and Freetrade, which debuted its stock lending program just last week. Most companies that offer such programs in the U.K. pass on 50% of the interest to clients. That is higher than the 15% Robinhood is offering to lenders on its platform. Share lending is risky  not least due to the prospect that a borrower may end up defaulting on their obligation and be unable to return the value of the share to the lender. But Robinhood says on its lander page for stock lending that it aims to hold cash \"equal to a minimum of 100% of the value of your loaned stocks at a third-party bank,\" meaning that customers should be covered if either Robinhood or the institution borrowing the shares suddenly couldn't return them. Robinhood keeps cash collateral in a trust account with Wilmington Trust, National Association, through JP Morgan Chase & Co acting as custodian, a spokesperson for the firm told CNBC. Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fintech firm Sardine.ai, said that the risk to users of Robinhood's share lending program will be \"quite low\" given the U.S. firm is behind the risk management and selecting which individuals and institutions get to borrow customer shares. \"I doubt the consumer understands the product but then they don't have to,\" Taylor told CNBC via email.  \"It's a case of, push this button to also make an additional 5% from the stock that was sitting there anyway. Feels like a no brainer.\" \"It's also the kind of thing that's common in big finance but just not available to the mainstream,\" he added. The new product offering might be a test for Robinhood when it comes to gauging how open local regulators are to accepting new product innovations. Financial regulators in the U.K. are strict when it comes to investment products, requiring firms to provide ample information to clients to ensure they're properly informed about the risk attached to the products they're buying and trading activities they're practicing. Under Britain's Financial Conduct Authority's consumer duty rules, firms must be open and honest, avoid causing foreseeable harm, and support investors' ability to pursue their financial goals, according to  guidance published on the FCA website  in July last year. Still, the move is also a chance for Robinhood to try to build out its presence in the U.K. market, which apart from a select number of European Union countries  is its only major international market outside of the U.S. It comes as domestic U.K. trading firms have faced difficulties over the years.  Hargreaves Lansdown, for example, last month agreed  a 5.4 billion ($7.1 billion) acquisition by a group of investors including CVC Group. The company has been battling issues including regulatory changes, new entrants into the market,  including Revolut , and the expectation of falling interest rates. Unlike Robinhood, which doesn't charge commission fees, Hargreaves Lansdown charges a variety of different fees for consumers buying and selling shares on its platform."

        "content": "A little over three years ago, private equity investor Orlando Bravo called FTX the \"most cutting-edge, sophisticated cryptocurrency exchange in the world,\" as his buyout firm helped lead a  $900 million investment  in the company at a valuation of $18 billion. Bravo now tells CNBC that he and his firm, Thoma Bravo, are permanently out of crypto after that disaster. FTX spiraled into bankruptcy in late 2022, and founder Sam Bankman-Fried is in the early days of serving a  25-year prison sentence  for the massive fraud and conspiracy that doomed FTX and sister hedge fund Alameda Research. \"Once you make a mistake and once you get burned on something, our philosophy and my philosophy is you never touch it again,\" Bravo said in an interview on  CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday . \"Even if it turns out that you missed a big boom.\" FTX marked a sideways turn for San Francisco-based Thoma Bravo, which has emerged as a giant investor in technology, orchestrating multibillion-dollar acquisitions in recent years of companies including cybersecurity software vendor  Proofpoint , property management software company  RealPage , finance and supply chain software developer  Anaplan  and spend management software company  Coupa.

Founded in 2008, the firm now oversees roughly $160 billion in assets. At the time of Thoma Bravo's investment in FTX, the crypto exchange was riding the wave of soaring crypto prices. Bankman-Fried was an industry icon, having built his company into one of the world's largest exchanges in about two years. \"We are thrilled to partner with FTX on their next phase of growth as they create a new ecosystem for crypto,\" Bravo said in the July 2021 press release. His firm's investment in the round  reportedly  amounted to $130 million. By November 2022,  the value of FTX stood at zero  and top executives were being  accused  of siphoning more than $8 billion in customer funds. Bravo said on Thursday that the blockchain technology underlying crypto still has promise. But whether it's bitcoin itself or a company in the space, Bravo is staying away. \"Personally, I'm a believer in blockchain. I think it's a powerful way of doing many things and for many use cases, and I've always believed that,\" Bravo said. \"From an investment standpoint, after you make a mistake, you kind of move on.\" WATCH:   Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison"

        "content": "The X accounts of two family members of Republican presidential nominee  Donald Trump  appeared to have been hacked Tuesday in order to promote a scam aimed at cashing in on the Trump family's  nascent crypto venture . The hacks come as the former president prepares to release his crypto policy platform, and his campaign wrestles with  the fallout of a foreign cyberattack . Shortly after 8:15 p.m. ET, the X account belonging to Trump's daughter-in-law, Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump appeared to announce that the digital currency project, dubbed World Liberty Financial, had been launched. The account provided several links to Trump's 1.7 million followers to a coin and websites claiming to be \"the only official channels of World Liberty Financial.\" One minute later, Donald Trump's youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump's X account also posted an endorsement and a website link. The website linked to in the Trump family posts had been created earlier in the day Tuesday and registered via an anonymous domain hosting platform called Njalla Okta LLC, according to domain lookup site WhoIs.com. Domiciled in the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, Njalla Okta was created by a cofounder of The Pirate Bay, a dark-web marketplace. All of which makes it nearly impossible for the public to trace the identity of the person behind the fake World Liberty Financial sites. A few minutes after Lara Trump's posts, her husband, Donald Trump's son Eric Trump, appeared to use his own X account to write \"This is a scam!!\" He wrote that his wife and his sister's \"profiles have been compromised.\" All of these posts, including Eric Trump's warning, have since been deleted. But not before screenshots captured the contents. Spokespeople for the Trump presidential campaign and the Trump Organization did not reply to requests for comment Tuesday about the reported hacks, or the status of the Trump crypto venture. CNBC also contacted Eric Trump for comment via X, and did not immediately receive a reply. The incident is the latest apparent stumble in the Trump family's effort to launch a crypto platform. Since June, multiple digital tokens supposedly backed by the Trump team or members of the Trump family have launched. CNBC could not independently verify that any of them were directly connected to the billionaire Republican presidential nominee's family. One was dubbed DJT, the same call letters as Trump Media Technology Group's ticker symbol on the Nasdaq exchange. The coin pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars  before the founders pulled the funds  in early August, sending the coin plummeting in value. The World Liberty project already appears to have  missed one deadline  last week, for a planned announcement. The project comes in the wake of Trump's  keynote speech this summer at the annual Bitcoin Conference  in which he declared his intent, among other things, to create a national reserve of Bitcoin if elected president. Trump has been keen to ally himself with the crypto crowd, which has proven to be the largest single industry source of donations to either party this campaign cycle. Nearly half of  all the corporate funds  donated this election cycle have been from the crypto industry. Tuesday's incident appeared to affect the price of solana, a separate cryptocurrency token named in the supposedly fake posts. Immediately after they were sent, the price of solana fell 9% before recovering to about $126. Lara Trump had described an accompanying governance token on solana which would support the DeFi lending protocol, World Liberty Financial. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, describes a parallel banking system which cuts out middlemen like banks and lawyers and replaces them with something known as smart contracts, which are pieces of code that self-execute when certain conditions are met."

It was the third-biggest gain for the stock since the company's IPO in January 2021. Shares closed at $41.66. Affirm said late Wednesday that revenue in the  fiscal fourth quarter  climbed 48% from a year earlier to $659 million, and that its net loss narrowed to $45.1 million from $206 million in the same period a year ago. The company beat estimates for revenue and reported a narrower-than-expected loss. For the current quarter, Affirm sees revenue in the range of $640 million to $670 million. Analysts polled by LSEG called for revenue of $625 million. Affirm CEO Max Levchin said in a note to shareholders that the company set a new goal of hitting operating profitability on a GAAP basis by the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025. Analysts for Mizuho called it a \"killer quarter\" for Affirm in a note Thursday, and said the \"prospect of turning GAAP operating income-positive\" will be \"a major milestone.\" Even after Thursday's rally, Affirm shares are still down about 15% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 19%. But the stock has been trending higher lately, up 47% in August. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled Friday that lower interest rates could be coming as soon as September. Bank of America analysts said in a note last month that rate cuts would be beneficial to Affirm's funding costs and for gain on loan sales. The company moved its merchants to a 36% APR cap on loans, up from 30% previously, and analysts said this \"should remain a tailwind for yields and GMV growth.\" Mizuho projects that a new  Apple  Pay partnership could add $12 billion to Affirm's total addressable market once it goes live later this year.

        "content": "British financial technology firm Zilch on Tuesday reported its first-ever month of profit, marking a key milestone for the company as it looks toward an eventual initial public offering. In a trading update, Zilch, which competes with the likes of Klarna and  Block  in the buy now, pay later space, said that it made an operating profit in July 2024, hitting profitability within four years of its founding date  faster than other major consumer fintechs that have also managed to break even. Competitors Starling and Monzo, meanwhile, took more than three and four years to make their first profit, respectively. Others have managed to hit profitability faster. Digital banking startup Revolut, for example,  broke even for the first time just two years after its  launch.  Zilch also said it topped 100 million ($130 million) in annual revenue run rate, doubling from the run rate it reported last year. Philip Belamant, Zilch's CEO and co-founder, told CNBC Tuesday that, despite the current high-interest rate environment, the firm was able to hit profitability by growing its business rather than cutting back like other fintechs have done. \"If you think of the last two and a half, three years, a lot of VC-backed companies, especially high growth fintech businesses have had to cut their way to get to profitability. And some of those have actually cut so far they went bust along the way,\" Belamant told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\" \"It's not been easy. And, for Zilch, we took a different approach. We looked at this and said let's grow our way to profitability,\" Belamant added. Separately Tuesday, Zilch announced the appointment of former Aviva CEO Mark Wilson to its board. Wilson, who was made a non-executive director, said he was \"excited\" to join the firm at a critical juncture and \"further help Zilch steer its path toward sustainable success as a category leader.\" Zilch's CEO Belamant told CNBC in June that he wants to  list the business publicly  in the next 12 to 24 months. That same month, the company announced that it had raised $125 million of initial debt financing from Deutsche Bank. That deal, which gives Zilch the option to draw down up to $315 million of credit from both Deutsche Bank and other banks, is expected to help the company triple its overall sales volumes in the next couple of years, according to the firm. Klarna, which Zilch competes with in the U.K., is also planning a  stock market flotation  in the medium term, with its CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski having previously told CNBC it wouldn't be \"impossible\" for the firm to list as soon as this year."

        "content": "On Thursday morning,Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumptold his 90 million followers on X that they would hear his plan to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet that same day. But after a rally in Michigan and a town hall in Wisconsin, Thursday ended with no sign of Trump's plan for digital assets. A campaign spokesman did not reply when CNBC asked what happened to the crypto plan rollout. Throughout the day Thursday, CNBC heard from several pro-crypto Trump supporters who were eagerly anticipating what the Republican nominee might say. A town hall Thursday night moderated by bitcoin supporter and former Congressman, Tulsi Gabbard seemed like the ideal setting. But Trump said nothing about crypto. Earlier on Thursday, the GOP pick pumped upthe Trump Organization's new crypto platform, which has just been rebranded from \"The DeFiant Ones,\" to \"World Liberty Financial.\" In a post on X , the former president shared a video of himself with voiceover: \"This afternoon, I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the  crypto capital  of the planet. They want to choke you. They want to choke you out of business. We're not going to let that happen.\" It was unclear who Trump meant by \"they,\" and a Trump campaign spokesman did not respond to questions from CNBC about the announcement.  In Trump's post on Thursday morning, hetagged a verified X account called \"World Liberty Fi,\" or WLFI . The account has more than 32,000 followers and a handful of posts that began on Aug. 22. The project also involves Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. \"Excited to announce the launch of @WorldLibertyFi! A new era in finance is here,\" Eric said Wednesday  in a post on X . The crypto project's accompanying Telegram channel, which has also been renamed World Liberty Financial, had more than 57,000 subscribers as of Thursday evening, and climbing. The announcement came a day after Trump  launched a new round of his NFT trading cards . Like the crypto platform, the nonfungible tokens are a private Trump family enterprise in the digital currency space, and are not officially connected to Trump's presidential campaign. But the campaign and the private businesses dovetail, in that the NFTs and the crypto platform are promoted as part of Trump's political brand, and they are marketed to his supporters. For Trump, these private crypto enterprises offer an opportunity to both lure crypto voters and donors, and to make money. The Republican nominee has been leaning into being the pro-crypto candidate for president, delivering increasingly bullish talking points on the industry. Donations and endorsements from the crypto voting bloc have followed. The latest tally from the Trump camp put the total crypto-related raise at $25 million. CNBC has not been able to independently verify that figure. As of Thursday, it was unclear what the World Liberty Financial platform would specifically do, and whether the project was operational. Two of Trump's sons, Eric and and Donald Trump Jr.,have offered varying accounts of what the digital bank plans to provide to users. Trump's eldest son recently said the family was working to develop a crypto platform that would rival the traditional banking system. \"I think there has been a lot of inequality in that only certain people can get financing [...] so this notion of decentralized finance is obviously very appealing to guys like me who have been debanked,\" Donald Trump Jr. said in the interview on Locals. Eric meanwhile  told the New York Post the project involved digital real estate, which could mean tokenizing real-world assets or refer to selling digitized versions of assets in the metaverse. The former president described the project last week to his 7.5 million followers on Truth Social  as a way to \"take a stand  together.\" \"For too long, the average American has been squeezed by the big banks and financial elites,\" Trump wrote."

        "header": "How Trump was 'orange-pilled' by three bitcoiners in Puerto Rico and the promise of $100 million",
        "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn.  A block away from the neon-lit buzz of Lower Broadway, where honky-tonk pours onto the city's main drag at all hours, stands the Music City Center, a venue that's hosted everything from  craft beer conferences  to a performance by the  legendary Dolly Parton . In late July, the complex filled up for something entirely different. It was the  biggest bitcoin conference  of the year, and the headline act was none other than former President  Donald Trump . For nearly 50 minutes on a Saturday afternoon in the country music capital, the Republican nominee for president extolled the virtues of bitcoin and spelled out what a second Trump administration would mean for the crypto industry to a packed crowd of conferencegoers who'd spent hours getting through the Secret Service's tight security protocol. \"If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,\"Trump declared, in a message targeted to the industry's bitcoin miners, who secure the network by running large banks of high-powered machines. \"We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, 'Please, please, President, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it!'\" The speech, which read like it was straight out of a bitcoiner's bible, was quite the about-face for an ex-president who three years earlier had dismissed the cryptocurrency as a  \"scam.\"  Trump was, no doubt, lured by the potential of huge amounts of donor money from an industry that sees itself as under constant attack from the Biden-Harris administration and the heavy regulatory hand of SEC Chair  Gary Gensler . Trump told the audience in Nashville that he'd raised $25 million in crypto-related funds, a number that CNBC hasn't been able to independently verify. Turning Trump from a skeptic into a sudden bitcoin evangelist took the work, behind closed doors, of a small army of bitcoiners and other crypto advocates who were able to maneuver their way into the candidate's inner circle. In particular, three friends in Puerto Rico came together to try and convince the Republican presidential hopeful of bitcoin's value, and to eventually make that position loud and clear to a key audience in Nashville. In bitcoin parlance, Trump was \"orange-pilled.\" It's a play on the phrase \"red pill\" from the 1999 film, \"The Matrix.\" In the movie, the main character, Neo (played by Keanu Reeves), is given a choice of taking a red pill, which offers access to the unsettling truth about the world, or a blue pill, which signifies a false but far more comforting version of reality. Orange pill refers to bitcoin's official color and represents a person's dedication to bitcoin over fiat currencies. Within the matrix of confidantes, friends, family members and colleagues united in their mission to orange-pill Trump were the trio of Puerto Rico residents: Amanda Fabiano, the shadow chief of bitcoin miners; Tracy Hoyos-Lpez, a former California prosecutor; and David Bailey, CEO of media group BTC Inc. and organizer of the conference in Nashville. Earlier this year, Bailey promised to turn out  $100 million and 5 million votes  for Trump. CNBC is told an update on fundraising numbers is coming soon. Over the Memorial Day weekend at a steakhouse called Bottles in the Guaynabo suburb of San Juan, the three began mapping out a plan as they shared family style dishes. Here's how Fabiano recounted the initial exchange to CNBC. \"We were at dinner with a bunch of people, and David was like, 'Hey, I've been talking to the administration, and I want to do a roundtable on mining, Can we chat this weekend?'\" Fabiano said. Bailey had spent months in dialogue with the Trump campaign, swapping bitcoin briefs and messages. He was about to make the 1,600-mile trek to meet the former president for the first time at Trump Tower in Manhattan, and was keen to deliver details of a potentially lucrative fundraiser and a miners working group featuring some of the top CEOs in the industry. It would serve as a prelude for what was to come in Nashville. Hoyos-Lpez, Bailey's neighbor, had been recently orange-pilled, and was anxious to help out any way she could in getting Trump to Nashville. She happened to have a contact in the Trump orbit who was willing to make an introduction. Meanwhile, Fabiano's history in bitcoin mining was important in giving the group street cred. \"Without Amanda, we wouldn't have had the legitimacy to sell that this is a legitimate business,\" Hoyos-Lpez said. \"She is the mining queen. She's got all the miners.\" Hoyos-Lpez added that many miners are former Wall Street executives. \"If you want to be taken seriously, you have to take serious people,\" she said. \"And it doesn't get any more serious than miners.\" The Trump campaign didn't respond to multiple inquiries about Trump's latest crypto fundraising stats, his changed views on bitcoin and the events leading up to his appearance in Nashville. Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies are created by miners around the world running high-powered computers that collectively validate transactions and simultaneously create new tokens. Their massive physical presence shows up in the form of sprawling data centers across the globe and offers a tangible image for newbies to understand an otherwise abstract technology. Fabiano described it as a natural fit \"when thinking about how to explain bitcoin to Trump in a way that makes sense.\" Bitcoin often gets a bad rap for the amount of energy it consumes, which is just shy of  how much power Egypt  uses annually. But as mining requires tremendous amounts of energy, the industry is developing innovative methods of producing and sharing it. Miners can partner with utilities in a way that allows them to return energy to the grid when there's excessive demand. They're also utilizing untapped sources of renewable energy, often concentrated in remote parts of the country, helping to create an economy in areas that would otherwise be dormant. That could all lead to the U.S. becoming a greater producer of energy, which is of particular importance to satisfy the needs of the artificial intelligence boom. Bailey confirmed that he flew to New York to meet with Trump, but he wouldn't share specifics about what was said in the meeting. What's clear is that, soon thereafter, Trump agreed to host about a dozen crypto executives and experts for a 90-minute roundtable in a small tea room at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. That meeting took place in mid-June, two weeks after the dinner at Bottles. To get Trump on board with the big shindig in Nashville, Bailey, Fabiano and Hoyos-Lpez knew they needed the right mix of people to clearly explain the virtues of mining and to convince the nominee that donations would be large enough to make the event worth his time. \"It was like, 'Who would we put in the room? Who would be the best people to explain this, right? Who would be willing to put dollars up, kind of put their skin in the game?' And that was how it all got started,\" Fabiano said. Those who committed to going pitched in $500,000 apiece to a fundraising committee, according to multiple attendees. Fabiano, who had never previously been involved in politics or campaigning, said the biggest concern among prospective attendees was the fear of appearing partisan. She said ahead of the meeting there was \"a prep call for agenda items.\" Fabiano put together a presentation for the Trump team with background material on the miners who would be at the Mar-a-Lago roundtable to show that, \"We are real people, and we are real businesses, and you should take us seriously.\" With thunderstorms bearing down on the Atlantic coast, the Mar-a-Lago attendees, including representatives from  Riot Platforms , Marathon Digital Holdings , TeraWulf  and  Core Scientific , forfeited their smartphones to a radio-frequency identification pouch that blocked incoming and outgoing signals. From under a large chandelier, they listened to the former president engage on the nuances of America's energy deficit, bitcoin mining, AI, and competition with China. \"That roundtable really set off like, 'OK, this industry is real, and they're showing up with dollars, and they're showing up with like, actual smart things to say and agenda items that are important to America,'\" said Fabiano. After years of facing political backlash, Fabiano said she was glad Trump took an active interest in \"digging in and learning about why this industry is real\" and \"why we're not a bunch of criminals.\" Fabiano and crew knew they weren't starting from scratch with Trump. Bailey started talks with the Trump camp in March.   In April, Trump launched his latest nonfungible token collection on the Solana blockchain. In May , he became the first major presidential nominee to accept cryptocurrency donations. He'd started talking on the campaign trail about defending so-called self-custody of coins and vowed at the Libertarian National Convention in May to keep  Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., and \"her goons\" away from bitcoin holders. In early June in San Francisco, technologists, crypto executives and venture capitalists paid up to $300,000 per ticket to join a Trump fundraiser that ultimately raised more than $12 million . The more Trump raised, the more he leaned into his newfound support. \"There are a lot of people in Trump's orbit that are fans of bitcoin,\" said Bailey. \"There are members of his family that are fans of bitcoin. Donald Trump has sold real estate for bitcoin. I just bought a pair of sneakers from him in bitcoin.\" Bailey said Trump's journey from cynic to fan is relatable. He said  Michael Saylor , the billionaire founder of  MicroStrategy , was once a skeptic and that he's been on a personal journey himself for 12 years. \"There is no necessarily single person who's responsible for orange-pilling him,\" Bailey said, of Trump. \"I think in terms of him having a 180 on this topic, that is really a very natural thing.\" After months of dialogue with Trump and his aides, Bailey said he thinks the former president's attraction to bitcoin is that it \"represents a transformational opportunity for the country.\" \"In that sense, I think it's kind of a match made in heaven,\" he said. Hoyos-Lpez said the period between the Mar-a-Lago meeting in June and the Nashville conference late last month was \"agonizing,\" as the group waited for an answer. The first \"yes\" from the Trump camp was to the meeting in Manhattan, and the news was delivered by phone to Hoyos-Lpez while Bailey was in Japan. The conference was more than a month out. Hoyos-Lpez said she jumped in her car and drove to Bailey's house so she and his wife, Emily, could prepare the one suit he had in his closet. \"We couldn't find any dry cleaners that would have this in time in Puerto Rico,\" Hoyos-Lpez said. \"We ended up having to get super creative, like putting his suit in the dryer, putting his suit in the sun, steaming it.\" There was a lot of work to be done in a little amount of time. Soon after the Mar-a-Lago roundtable, Trump said yes to Nashville. \"I'm a criminal attorney, I was a prosecutor, so I'm used to dealing with very big and very emotional moments, but not treating them as such,\" Hoyos-Lpez said. \"While everyone is excited and celebrating, I'm like, 'Alright, well, we need to sit down and figure it out.'\" Three months earlier, Bailey's wildest dream was to get Trump to Nashville. He talked about it often with his core group of friends in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory with crypto-friendly policies, including huge tax breaks to those who spend at least 183 days on the island each year. \"Never in a million years, did we think we were going to be here,\" Hoyos-Lpez said. \"Getting a presidential candidate to the Bitcoin Conference was definitely one of the coolest things that I probably will ever do in my life.\" At the conference, Hoyos-Lpez, Fabiano and Bailey worked to stage a second roundtable with Trump. They brought in a wider set of industry participants, including the Winklevoss twins, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick. Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus and some top mining executives were also there, along with a smattering of politicians. Trump, in his keynote, donned a blue-and-white-striped tie and an American flag pinned to the lapel of his navy blue suit. He declared that a Trump White House would \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future,\" and said he would fire SEC Chair Gensler. To Fabiano, Bailey, and Hoyos-Lpez, the stakes couldn't possibly be higher, as Democratic nominee  Kamala Harris  gains momentum in the polls. \"Our industry as a whole will cease to exist if Trump doesn't win,\" Hoyos-Lpez said. \"There are some rumors out there that Harris is trying to change her stance on crypto as a whole, and to appear more friendly, but I just don't believe anything that they say.\" Hoyos-Lpez said she's now focused on getting out votes and rallying bitcoiners who she says are \"single-issue voters.\" \"Yes, the money that you get in is very important,\" she said. \"But what really matters at the end of the day is votes.\" Less than a week after leaving Nashville, Fabiano, Hoyos-Lpez and Bailey were back together closer to home to process all that had happened. They met at a restaurant called Santaella and shared a mix of Puerto Rican tapas, including a personal favorite  goat cheese quesadilla with nuts and honey on top. \"We just sat down and had a conversation about like, 'Holy crap. We did this,'\" Hoyos-Lopez said. \"We created the table, and we brought everyone to the table, which is literally what this community is all about.\" WATCH:   Trump caters to crypto crowd"

        "header": "Crypto industry accounts for almost half of corporate donations in 2024 election, report says",
        "content": "As the 2024 U.S. elections reach their home stretch, crypto companies are opening their wallets to try and influence the results. Nearly half of all the corporate money flowing into the election has come from the crypto industry,  according to a report  this week from the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen. The sum, approximately $119 million, was raised from a mix of contributors, with  Coinbase  and Ripple accounting for more than 80% of the donations. Most of the money is going to super PACs that are backing pro-crypto candidates running for office this year. The industry has faced heightened scrutiny during the Biden administration, and  Coinbase  and  Ripple  are two of the biggest players that have been engaged in legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Donald Trump , the Republican nominee, has tried to exploit the rift between the crypto industry and the Democrats by pitching himself as the pro-crypto choice and even  keynoting  a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last month. But money is flowing into both parties, as the House, Senate and the presidency remain very much up for grabs. No other sector is keeping up with crypto. That includes oil companies and banks, which have historically been big political contributors. Since 2010, when the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling opened the door for limitless corporate money in U.S. elections, the crypto sector has accounted for 15% of all disclosed contributions, according to the report from Public Citizen. More than 90% of the corporate crypto cash that's been raised was brought in this election cycle. Rick Claypool, research director at Public Citizen, who authored the latest report, said the massive money poured in by crypto companies to \"silence crypto's critics and elevate its backers embodies everything that is wrong with the Supreme Court's disastrousCitizens Uniteddecision.\" Claypool's research shows that crypto corporations are second only to fossil fuel conglomerates in total election-related spending since the 2010 ruling. Fairshake is the most popular of the pro-crypto, bipartisan super PACs. It's funded by some of the industry's leading companies and has become one of the top-spending PACs this year. The majority of the group's funds can be traced to four sources. Coinbase has contributed $49 million, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz has donated $47 million,Ripple has given $47 millionand Jump Crypto put in $15 million. In total, Fairshake and its two affiliated PACs have raised around $169 million, with more than 90% coming directly from corporations. Other funds have come from a mix of donors. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, for example, gave $1 million, while the Winklevoss twins put in $5 million. A filing with the Federal Election Commission  on Tuesday showed that during July, Fairshake disbursed almost $75 million.  Data compiled from FEC reports by OpenSecrets  indicates that Fairshake has nearly $120 million in its coffers to deploy with less than 80 days to go until the November election. The super PAC has pledged $25 million from that pool of cash to 18 House candidates in the general election, to be split among nine Democrats and nine Republicans. It's committed another $18 million to three Senate races. The industry's strategy paid off in the primaries. Public Citizen's report found that of the 42 primary races that attracted money from crypto-backed super PACs, the candidate picked by the crypto industry won 36. But many of them aren't publicly promoting their stance on crypto. \"When Fairshake and its affiliates spend money to influence races, either by attacking crypto skeptics or boosting crypto supporters, the ads don't mention crypto at all,\" said Claypool. In New York and California congressional races, the crypto-funded campaign ads attacked the targeted candidates with traditional political jabs, and no mention of crypto. \"The sole reason crypto is a hot-button topic in this election cycle is that crypto businesses are spending eye-popping sums to make themselves impossible to ignore,\" Claypool said. Democrats are trying to show they can find common ground with the industry despite the tension that's emerged in recent years. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., kicked off a  virtual town hall dubbed \"Crypto4Harris\"  in August. He said at the event that a crypto law could pass the Senate by the end of the year. Vice President  Kamala Harris's  campaign team is actively working to craft a platform stance around the crypto industry and reset the approach taken by President  Joe Biden ,  several key Democrats told CNBC.  On Tuesday, Harris' campaign announced plans to adopt a pro-crypto innovation stance. Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad praised the move,  writing on X  that he's been \"pleased to take part in a number of discussions with the Harris team.\" He described the approach as \"constructive\" and said \"the dialogue had been an important first step.\" This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Looking for alternatives to Nvidia? Futurum CEO names 3 he's bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside Meanwhile, money has rolled into Trump's campaign from digital asset executives since he leaned into being the pro-crypto candidate. Trump has adopted increasingly bullish  talking points  on cryptocurrencies on the campaign trail, and he announced in late July that he had raised $25 million from crypto interests, a figure that CNBC hasn't independently confirmed. Crypto executives have turned up at fundraisers for Trump  in San Francisco  and  Nashville , where the Republican nominee told an audience of conferencegoers that if he were returned to the White House, he would ensure that the federal government never sells off its bitcoin holdings. \"This afternoon I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world,\" Trump said. \"And we'll get it done.\""

Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG. Affirm reported gross merchandise volume, or GMV, of $7.2 billion, up 31% from a year earlier. GMV is a key industry metric that helps gauge the total value of transactions over the reporting window. Revenue climbed 48% from a year earlier, and Affirm's net loss narrowed to $45.1 million from $206 million in the same period a year ago.  The company's active merchant count hit more than 300,000 and active consumers also grew 19% to 18.6 million.  Affirm CEO Max Levchin said in a note to shareholders that the company set a new goal of hitting operating profitability on a GAAP basis by the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025. For the current quarter, Affirm sees revenue in the range of $640 million and $670 million. Analysts polled by LSEG called for revenue of $625 million.  Affirm shares were down 36% for the year as of Wednesday's close, but have been trending higher lately, up 12% in August. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled Friday that lower interest rates could be coming as soon as September.  Bank of America analysts said in a note last month that rate cuts would be beneficial to Affirm's funding costs and for gain on loan sales. The company moved its merchants to a 36% APR cap on loans, up from 30% previously, and analysts said this \"should remain a tailwind for yields and GMV growth.\" The analysts said that Affirm's new relationship with  Apple  plus other partnerships with  Amazon  and  Shopify  are also helping.  In June , Affirm and Apple  announced plans  for U.S. Apple Pay users on iPhones and iPads to be able to apply for loans directly through Affirm. Affirm also plans to launch in the UK by the end of this year. Gina Sanchez, chief market strategist at Lido Advisors,  told CNBC's \"The Exchange\"  on Wednesday that the consumer slowdown could make it difficult for the the company to achieve its profitability goals. \"This is a buy now, pay later company in an environment where consumption is falling,\" said Sanchez. \"You have to be prepared for a pretty slow period that could come in the first half of 2025 until rate cuts really start to take hold, because that's just the reality of being in a consumer play that requires consumption volume.\" WATCH:   Affirm CEO on consumer behavior"

        "content": "Crypto marketplace OpenSea has been added to the SEC's list of targets, as the regulator extends its crackdown on the sector. The company's CEO said  in a post on X  on Wednesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells notice against OpenSea. A Wells notice is typically one of the final steps before the SEC issues formal charges.It generally lays out the framework of the regulatory argument and offers the potentially accused an opportunity to rebut the SEC's claims. The letter, according to the OpenSea chief, alleges that the nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, sold on its platform are securities. OpenSea is a popular platform that allows users to create, sell and buy NFTs. OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer wrote in a post that the company was \"shocked the SEC would make such a sweeping move against creators and artists\" but that they are \"ready to stand up and fight.\" Finzer calls it a \"move into uncharted territory.\" \"By targeting NFTs, the SEC would stifle innovation on an even broader scale: hundreds of thousands of online artists and creatives are at risk, and many do not have the resources to defend themselves,\" he added, noting that the company has pledged $5 million to cover legal fees for NFT creators and developers who receive a Wells notice. OpenSea directed CNBC to a blog post by Finzer, in addition to the social media post. In it, the OpenSea CEO adds that classifying NFTs as securities would \"misinterpret the law\" and that he is confident his company \"operates legally\" and that its \"users aren't trading securities.\" So far this year, the SEC has sent Wells notices, filed lawsuits, or reached settlements with a host of crypto firms focused on ethereum and decentralized finance, including ShapeShift, TradeStation and Uniswap. The agency is also reportedly investigating the Ethereum Foundation. Centralized exchanges and trading platforms  Coinbase , Kraken, Binance, and  Robinhood  have also all been engaged in legal battles with the regulator. In May, investment platformRobinhoodannounced it received a Wells notice for the company's crypto operations. The SEC has also sued Coinbase and Binance.Meanwhile, a California judge on Friday ruled that the commission's case against Kraken would proceed to trial. With multiple pending legal challenges from the regulator and enduring uncertainty about the future of crypto regulation in the U.S., some crypto businesses have said they are considering decamping from the country altogether. SEC chair Gary Gensler has, in multiple interviews, repeatedly shared that he believes much of the industry already belongs under SEC jurisdiction, and its lawsuits are bringing the industry under compliance. Crypto firms argue that the recent legal battles haven't given the regulatory clarity the industry has been seeking for years. Republican presidential nominee and former president Donald Trump, who has branded himself as the pro-crypto candidate for president,  has pledged to \"fire\" Chair Gensler  from his post, should he win in November. While the president does not have the power to fire appointed commissioners. Even if Trump were to appoint a new and more crypto-friendly SEC chairman, Gensler would remain a commissioner on the independent agency."

        "content": "Klarna said it posted a profit in the first half of the year, swinging into the black from a loss last year as the buy now, pay later pioneer edges closer toward its hotly anticipated stock market debut. In results published Tuesday, Klarna said that it made an adjusted operating profit of 673 million Swedish krona ($66.1 million) in the six months through June 2024, up from a loss of 456 million krona in the same period a year ago. Revenue, meanwhile, grew 27% year-on-year to 13.3 billion krona. On a net income basis, Klarna reported a 333 million Swedish krona loss. However, Klarna cites adjusted operating income as its primary metric for profitability as it better reflects \"underlying business activity.\" Klarna is one of the biggest players in the so-called buy now, pay later sector. Alongside peers  PayPal ,  Block 's Afterpay, and  Affirm , these companies give consumers the option to pay for purchases via interest-free monthly installments, with merchants covering the cost of service via transa c tion fees. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and co-founder, said the company saw strong revenue growth in the U.S. in particular, where sales jumped 38% thanks to a ramp-up in merchant onboarding. \"Klarna's massive global network continues to expand rapidly, with millions of new consumers joining and 68k new merchant partners,\" Siemiatkowski said in a statement Tuesday. The company achieved its adjusted operating profit \"by focusing on sustainable, profitable growth and leveraging AI to lower costs,\" he added. Klarna has been one of the forerunners in the corporate world when it comes to touting the benefits of using AI to increase productivity and cut operating costs. On Tuesday, the company said that its average revenue per employee over the previous twelve months increased 73% year-over-year, to 7 million Swedish krona. It comes as Klarna tries to pitch itself as a primary banking provider for clients as it approaches a much-anticipated initial public offering. The firm earlier this month  launched its own checking account-like product , called Klarna balance, in a bid to persuade consumers to move more of their financial lives onto its app. The move highlighted how Klarna is looking to diversify beyond its core buy now, pay later product, for which it is primarily known. Klarna has yet to set a fixed timeline for the stock market listing, which is widely expected to be held in the U.S. However, in an interview with CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" in February, Siemiatkowski said an IPO this year was \"not impossible.\" \"We still have a few steps and work ahead of ourselves,\" he said. \"But we're keen on becoming a public company.\" Separately, Klarna earlier this year  offloaded its proprietary checkout technology business , which allows merchants to offer online payments, to a consortium of investors led by Kamjar Hajabdolahi, CEO and founding partner of Swedish venture capital firm BLQ Invest. The move, which Klarna called a \"strategic\" step, effectively removed competition for rival online checkout services including Stripe, Adyen, Block, and Checkout.com."

        "content": "Shares of  Rivian Automotive  dropped about 8% during premarket trading Friday after the electric vehicle startup delivered fewer vehicles in the third quarter than analysts had expected and lowered its annual production forecast for 2024. The  company said  the lower production target  down from 57,000 units to between 47,000 and 49,000   was because of a \"production disruption due to a shortage of a shared component\" for its R1 vehicles and commercial van. \"This supply shortage impact began in Q3 of this year, has become more acute in recent weeks and continues. As a result of the supply shortage, Rivian is revising its annual production guidance to be between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles,\" the company said in a statement. A Rivian spokesman said the component causing the problem is part of its in-house motors, but he declined to disclose any further details. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe during a Morgan Stanley investor conference last month alluded to problems with a number of suppliers: \"We've had a couple of supplier issues of recent that have been challenging and in particular, a few issues around our in-house motors with some of the components that have been painful and a reminder of just how a multi-tiered supply chain can be difficult.\" Despite the shortage, the company reaffirmed its annual delivery outlook of low single-digit growth as compared with 2023, which it expects to be in a range of 50,500 to 52,000 vehicles. Rivian disclosed the part shortage as part of reporting its vehicle production and delivery for the third quarter. The company produced 13,157 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois, during the period ended Sept. 30 and delivered 10,018 vehicles in that time. Analyst estimates compiled by FactSet expected deliveries of 13,000 vehicles during the third quarter. Shares of Rivian are down by more than 50% in 2024, as EV demand has been slower than expected and the company  has burned through a significant amount of cash ."

        "header": "Levi Strauss trims guidance as it weighs sale of Dockers business",
        "content": "Denim-crazed consumers are turning to  Levi Strauss & Co.  for new jeans, but its overall business is being dragged down by its Dockers brand, which the company is now considering selling off, it announced Wednesday. Sales at Levi's brand were up 5% during its fiscal third quarter  the biggest gain in two years  but overall revenue came in flat and lower than Wall Street had expected. Shares of Levi's fell more than 8% in extended trading Wednesday. Here's how the denim maker performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 25 was $20.7 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with $9.6 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $132 million, or 33 cents per share. Sales were largely flat at $1.52 billion, compared with $1.51 billion a year earlier. With one quarter left to go in the fiscal year, Levi's reaffirmed its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.17 to $1.27, in line with expectations of $1.25, according to LSEG.It expects earnings per share to be at the midpoint of that range. It trimmed its revenue guidance and is now expecting sales to grow 1%, compared with a previous range of between 1% and 3%. That's below the 2.3% growth that analysts had expected, according to LSEG. Levi's, which owns its namesake brand, as well as Dockers and Beyond Yoga, would have printed quite a different set of results had it not been for Dockers. It started that brand in 1986 to offer consumers an alternative to denim: khakis. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, khakis were a mainstay in most consumers' closets but these days, they have fallen out of fashion. The efforts that Levi's has made to differentiate Dockers led to too much overlap with the Levi's brand, which has expanded into a lifestyle brand that offers a lot more products than jeans. During the quarter, sales at Dockers were down 15% to $73.7 million while Beyond Yoga, the buzzy athleisure brand it acquired in 2021, saw sales grow 19% to $32.2 million. \"Over the last couple of years, the brand has underperformed.  We felt this was the right decision for the long term. Our view financially is the exit of Dockers will improve the company's overall margins and also minimize volatility in top-line growth,\" Levi's finance chief, Harmit Singh, told CNBC in an interview. \"We believe the exit of Dockers will allow both Dockers and Levi's to independently operate and maximize each other's value independently.\" Levi's has tapped  Bank of America  to lead the sale process. Beyond Docker's, Levi's is making gains in growing its profitability as it continues to shift its focus to selling directly to consumers. During the quarter, its gross margin rose by 4.4 percentage points, which Singh attributed to the direct-selling strategy, lower cotton costs and better products that didn't need to be marked down to be sold. Like other brands, Levi's has been working to carve out its direct selling strategy and reach more customers through its own stores and websites rather than through wholesalers like  Macy's . The strategy is a boon to profits because the margins are higher and it also allows brands to get closer to their customers through data collection. During the quarter, Levi's direct channel was up about 10%, driven by strength in the U.S. and 16% growth in e-commerce. Overall, direct sales comprised 44% of total revenue and Levi's wants to get that number closer to 55%. Behind those numbers are a slew of splashy marketing campaigns, which include a  new partnership  the jeans brand announced with Beyonc on Monday after the pop star released a song titled \"LEVII'S JEANS\" earlier this year on her  country album . \"Our strategic decision was to actually have Beyonc represent some of our core product. So in the first ad, chapter one, she's in ... 501s and an essential white t-shirt and it doesn't get more Levi's than that,\" CEO Michelle Gass told CNBC. \"Part of the success recipe for Levi's has been and will continue to be us living in the center of culture and bringing together the icon of Beyonc with the icon of Levi's, I don't think there's any better example of that.\" Sales in Levi's Europe business came in higher than expected at $406.6 million, ahead of StreetAccount estimates of $392 million, but sales in the Americas and Asia were lower. Levi's posted $757.2 million in sales in the Americas, below the $789.2 million that StreetAccount analysts had expected. In Asia, Levi's saw revenue of $247.1 million, below StreetAccount estimates of $258 million. \"China was a drag,\" Singh said of the region, which represents about 2% of Levi's overall business. \"It's got this macro headwinds, and we had some execution issues. We've just changed the leadership in China and over time we still believe in the long-term potential of China.\" In the Americas, beyond a slowdown at Docker's, sales were also impacted by one of Levi's largest wholesale customers in Mexico, Singh said. During the quarter, the partner had a cybersecurity breach, which constrained shipping times and impacted sales. The region is also working through some \"execution issues,\" said Singh."

        "header": "Nike withdraws guidance, postpones investor day as it gears up for CEO change",
        "content": "Nike  on Tuesday said it was withdrawing its full-year guidance and postponing its investor day as it gears up for a new CEO to take the helm. Last month, the company announced that CEO John Donahoe would be  stepping down  in October and replaced with longtime company veteran Elliott Hill, effective Oct. 14. Given the impending CEO change, the company has decided to withdraw its full-year guidance and intends to provide quarterly guidance for the balance of the year, executives said. \"This provides Elliot with the flexibility to reconnect with our employees and teams, evaluate the current strategies and business trends and develop our plans to best position the business for fiscal '26 and beyond,\" finance chief Matthew Friend said on an earnings call with analysts. When reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results in June, Nike cut its guidance for fiscal 2025 and said it was expecting sales to be down mid-single digits after it previously expected them to grow. Friend said since the fiscal year started, the company's \"revenue expectations have moderated... given traffic trends on Nike Digital, retail sales trends across the marketplace and final order books for spring.\" \"We continue to see indications of slight second-half improvement in revenue trends versus our first half,\" said Friend. \"As we plan to introduce and scale newness and innovation across the marketplace, we now expect gross margins to decline versus the prior year.\" Nike said it expects revenue in its current quarter to be down between 8% and 10% and gross margin to be down about 1.5 percentage points. That's worse than the 6.9% drop in revenue that LSEG analysts had expected. It's also postponing its investor day, originally scheduled for November. It's unclear when the meeting will be rescheduled. Shares fell about 5% in extended trading after the updates and after Nike delivered mixed results for its fiscal first quarter. Here's how the world's largest sneaker retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended August 31 was $1.05 billion, or 70 cents per share, compared with $1.45 billion, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier. Nike beat earnings expectations by 18 cents, but it fell short on revenue as it works to fix its product assortment and rework its approach to innovation. Sales dropped to $11.59 billion, down about 10% from $12.94 billion a year earlier. Nike's gross margin grew by 1.2 percentage points in the quarter to 45.4%, higher than the 44.4% that StreetAccount analysts had expected. Still, profits fell by nearly 28% during the quarter. Over the last year, Nike has been accused of falling behind on innovation and  ceding share to competitors  as it focused on selling directly to consumers through its own websites and stores rather than through wholesalers such as  Foot Locker  and  DSW . At first, the strategy was a boon to Nike's profits and sales during the Covid pandemic, but as it scaled, it got more complex and consumers started returning to stores and other in-person activities. During the quarter, Nike Direct sales were down 13% to $4.7 billion, while Nike digital sales were down 15%. Critics say Nike's focus on direct selling also led it to take its eye off innovation. Under Donahoe's leadership, the company grew annual sales by more than 31%, but it got there by  churning out legacy franchises  such as Air Force 1s, Dunks and Air Jordan 1s  not the groundbreaking styles that turned the company into a global powerhouse. Sales for those legacy franchises are no longer boosting sales in the same way they had previously, and as a result, the company has worked to cut off supply to drive up demand and recapture their cool factor. During the first quarter, sales for those franchises declined more than the overall business. Online sales for Air Force 1s, Dunks and Air Jordan 1s combined were down nearly 50%. Jordan brand alone was down double-digits during the quarter, and the company expects it to be down at the same rate for fiscal 2025. The company also expects overall online sales to be down double-digits in fiscal 2025. Last year, Donahoe started to acknowledge Nike needed to  mend its relationships  with wholesalers, but the company's board decided that Hill, who spent 32 years with Nike before retiring in 2020, would be the right person to lead its next chapter. Hill is known to be well-regarded among Nike's retail partners, when he takes over later this month, he'll have work to do to rebuild those relationships. Wholesalers have previously spoken out about Nike's product lineup and how the same old recycled franchises weren't doing enough to drive sales. They've also been working to keep their own inventories in line and have been careful about ordering too much product. Nike's fiscal first-quarter wholesale revenue was down 8% to $6.4 billion. \"The multi-brand environment is very competitive today, and it will take time to expand market share. This was reflected in our spring '25 order books, which came in roughly flat versus the prior year,\" Friend said on the earnings call, adding orders were a \"little lighter\" than expected. Compounding the issue is the overall sneaker market, which has been relatively stagnant in the U.S., and a slowdown in consumer spending on discretionary goods such as new clothes and shoes. Footwear sales in the U.S. are projected to grow by just 2% in 2024 compared with 2023 after barely budging between 2022 and 2023, according to Euromonitor. Athletic footwear is expected to grow by about 5.6%, the firm said. During the most recent quarter, Nike footwear sales in North America were down 14%, and apparel sales fell 10%. Converse, which Nike acquired in 2003, is also weighing down the company's overall performance. Sales fell 15% to $501 million during the quarter but performed better than the $493 million that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Nike's performance has also been weighed down by the uneven economy in China, Nike's third-largest market by revenue. Nike's performance in China is often an indicator of the region's financial health, and in late June, it warned of a \"softer outlook\" in the region. During its fiscal first quarter, Nike posted $1.67 billion in revenue in the region, slightly above the $1.62 billion that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Still, traffic was \"soft\" in the region and Friend said that Nike is \"not immune\" to China's challenging consumer environment. China's central bank recently unveiled its  largest stimulus measures  since the Covid pandemic, which is expected to give the region's economy a much-needed boost. Nike's fiscal first quarter concluded prior to those stimulus measures, but executives may share color on how sales are performing during the current period. Shares of Nike closed at $89.13 on Tuesday, down about 18% so far in 2024, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's gains of about 20%."

It now pencils in an adjusted operating income (AOI) margin between 5.5% to 7.0% for the full-year 2024 period, down from a \"double digit\" outlook. \"Deterioration in the global industry backdrop reflects a lower 2024 market forecast than at the beginning of the period, while competitive dynamics have intensified due to both rising industry supply, as well as increased Chinese competition,\" the automaker said. It also lowered projections for its industrial free cash flow to a range between minus 5 billion euros ($5.58 billion) to minus 10 billion euros, from a \"positive\" guidance previously, as a result of a lower anticipated AOI margin and temporarily higher working capital over the second half of this year. The automaker further attributed the revisions to its guidance to \"decisions to significantly enlarge remediation actions on North American performance issues,\" but supplied no additional details. Earlier this year, Stellantis was sued by shareholders in the U.S. who claimed the automaker defrauded them by concealing rising inventories and other items,  Reuters reported . This month, Stellantis' U.S. dealer network  criticized CEO Carlos Tavares  for the company's recent sales decreases, factory production cuts, among other decisions that they assessed as detrimental to the automaker's business. European shares of the carmakerclosed 14.7% lower on Monday.Shares on the New York Stock Exchange hit a new 52-week low Monday, closing down 12.5% to $14.05. British luxury carmaker Aston Martin, whose iconic models gained notoriety via appearances in the James Bond movie franchise, also flagged cuts in its profit margin and production target for the year. It  announced  a roughly 1,000-unit reduction in response to \"disruption in its supply chain and continued macroeconomic weakness in China,\" anticipating that its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2024 will now come in below the previous year's performance. The company said it no longer expects to achieve positive free cash flow in the second half of this year, and noted that its full-year gross margin is anticipated to come in below 40%, compared with a previous target of around that threshold. Aston Martin said it is \"addressing the supply chain challenges and continues to recognise the significant market opportunity that China represents as its macroeconomic environment improves.\" The company's shares closed 24.5% lower on Monday, its worst one-day fall since March 2020 according to LSEG data. The Stellantis and Aston Martin profit warnings come days after German automaker Volkswagen once more slashed its own annual outlook on Friday, now guiding for an operating return on sales of 5.6% in 2024, from a 6.5-7.0% range previously. In a Google-translated  bourse filing , it attributed its lowered projections to lagging developments in its passenger car and commercial vehicle brands, along with a \"deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, giving rise to further risks, particularly for the Core brand group.\" European carmakers have been struggling to retain their footing in China, whose own automakers are now targeting an expansion of their electric vehicle sales in Europe. The broader shift to EVs is \"increasingly putting European carmakers under pressure while total new car sales fail to return to pre-pandemic levels in their home markets,\" ING analysts warned at the start of this month. Volkswagen shares were down around 2% as markets closed in London."

        "content": "Deutsche Bank is striking a cautious tone on Dover 's stock ahead of the industrial conglomerate's upcoming earnings report. JimCrameris saying don't fall for it. The firm's wariness on Dover lands not long after the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle  generally seen as a positive development for economically sensitive corners of the market such as industrials. That's because lower rates are typically good for businesses' capital expenditure levels. And yet a recent pair of research reports on industrials  from Deutsche Bank and Barclays  paints a decidedly mixed view on Dover and the group overall, which includes fellow Club holdings Eaton and Stanley Black & Decker . The divide is readily apparent on Dover, which is one of our plays on data center buildouts to support the growth of artificial intelligence computing. Late Tuesday, Deutsche Bank listed Dover as a short-term sell idea, suggesting the company will report underwhelming results that may pressure shares later this month. Jim, on the other hand, rushed to Dover's defense Wednesday. \"I really, really don't want to sell this stock,\" he said during Wednesday's Morning Meeting. \"I think it'll go much higher.\" Analysts at Deutsche Bank listed a few reasons to support their short-term sell call on Dover, including the need to restate its earnings and guidance to account for the sale of its Environmental Solutions Group. While analysts estimates' will need to be revised lower accordingly, this should not surprise the market because the sale was announced way back in July . Plus, Dover was right to divest this unit, which makes garbage trucks and trash compactors, in the first place because it's a noncore business and the sale proceeds can be redeployed into more attractive opportunities. Analysts also argued that Dover may struggle to meet management's upbeat outlook call book-to-bill performance.On its July earnings call , CEO Richard Tobin said he expects Dover'sbook-to-bill ratio to be above 1 in the second half of 2024, a key threshold indicating more orders are being placed than filled. But analysts now see \"downside risk\" to Tobin's assessment. Dover remains \"one of the best-managed companies and they are not going to slip up on their execution here,\" Jim argued in response. The Club remains long Dover because its thermal connectors used in data centers should continue to see growing demand, while its biopharma business also is in recovery mode. For its part, Barclays on Wednesday issued a middle-of-the-road view on Dover. The firm bumped its price target on the stock to $190 a share from $186, arguing there's been a \"positive tone\" from the company regarding the organic sales growth and EPS outlook into 2025. Still, Barclays' new target is on par with the stock's price Wednesday, and it maintained a hold-equivalent rating. DOV YTD mountain Dover (DOV) year-to-date performance It's not just Dover in the spotlight. Other industrial stocks in our portfolio received price target increases this week, including Eaton, Stanley Black & Decker and Honeywell . Barclays raised its price target on Eaton to $327 a share from $319  right around where shares of the electrical equipment maker traded Wednesday. The analysts, who maintained their hold-equivalent rating, said investor expectations are \"appropriately optimistic\" for Eaton, which like Dover is benefiting from the data center buildout. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank lifted its PT on Eaton to $376 from $367, arguing the company should raise its full-year guidance when it reports quarterly results in a few weeks. Deutsche Bank has a buy rating on the stock. We have a 1 rating. Barclays and Deutsche Bank found harmony on Stanley Black & Decker. Both firms raised their price target on the DeWalt owner's stock to $100 a share from $96 while maintaining hold or hold-equivalent ratings. That is still below where Stanley Black & Decker shares traded Wednesday, at roughly $109 apiece. The stock has been red hot in recent weeks as the Fed's first rate cut approached then became reality. If the Fed continues delivering interest rate cuts, the toolmaker's sales could see a boost as lower borrowing costs typically spur activity in the housing market. Stanley Black & Decker remains one of the portfolio's favorite interest rate plays, though we maintain a 2 rating on the stock. That means we'd wait for a pullback before adding to our position. Honeywell's price target was increased only slightly at Deutsche Bank  up merely $1 to $226 a share  and left unchanged at Barclays. Deutsche Bank has a hold on the stock. Barclays has a buy-equivalent overweight. We have a 2 rating on shares, which traded a little above $204 each Wednesday. Potential upside could come from CEO Vimal Kapur taking a more aggressive approach to reshuffling Honeywell's portfolio to focus on faster-growing and higher-margin areas. Jim has been recommending this for awhile, though, and even recently threatened to exit if there's not real action taken by management soon . The conglomerate has reported modest revenue growth in recent quarters. \"This [stock] is crying out 'sell me,' and I don't like that but we have owned it for a long time and we know that there is huge value here,\" he said during the September Monthly Meeting . \"Call me an unhappy holder waiting for better news. We better get some concrete evidence of a plan.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long ETN, HON, DOV, SWK. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "header": "We're upping our price target on Costco after another steady quarter fortifies our thesis",
        "content": "Costco on Thursday reported ho-hum quarterly results, with a small topline miss being more than offset by strong profitability to deliver an earnings beat. The report didn't blow us away, but it still offered plenty of reminders on why Costco investors should stick around. Total revenue in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter totaled $79.7 billion, missing analysts' expectations of $79.97 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Sales were up 1% year over year, though the year-ago quarter had an additional week, skewing the comparison. Earnings per share in the 16-week period came in at $5.29, topping analysts' forecasts of $5.08, LSEG data showed. The earnings result includes a non-recurring tax benefit of 14-cents per share. But even after removing it, the bottom line results were still better than expected. Costco Wholesale Why we own it: Costco is the best-run retailer in the world, with a business model focused on offering its members a relatively small universe of products at hard-to-beat prices. Costco has succeeded for decades, but the high inflation of recent years has made the company's value-focused ethos really shine. Competitors: BJ's Wholesale , Walmart and fellow Club holding Amazon Last buy: June 15, 2020 Initiation date: Jan. 27, 2020 Shares of Costco edged lower in extended trading Thursday by about 1.4%, to around $889 each, adding to modest losses during the regular session. The stock  one of our top-performers this year, up nearly 37%  closed at a record high of $917.08 per share Monday. Bottom line There's nothing to be concerned about with Costco's fourth-quarter results, even though sales came up short. The miss was marginal and more than offset by solid year-over-year expansion at both the gross margin and operating margin levels, which enabled the earnings beat. When normalizing for the extra week in last year's fourth quarter and removing the aforementioned tax-related benefit, adjusted earnings per share were up 12.6% on an annual basis. Membership fee income of $1.5 billion was a tad light, but keep in mind the recent fee hike  announced in July and implemented Sept. 1  is not factored into Thursday's results. To be sure, its impact in Costco's now-underway fiscal 2025 will be \"minimal\" early on, CFO Gary Millerchip noted on the call. \"The vast majority of the benefit will come in the back half of fiscal year 2025 and into fiscal year 2026.\" We left the earnings call with increased conviction that Costco remains a top destination for anyone seeking the most bang for their buck  and these days, who isn't? Costco is staying true to its mission and finding new ways to reduce its own costs. The company is then passing those cost savings on to its members, attempting to cut prices whenever possible and otherwise keep them steady. If Costco's suppliers are expected to try lowering prices when they can, then \"we're going to start with setting that example and showing the benefits of investing in price and driving unit volume. So, we are doing that,\" CEO Ron Vachris said. \"But we are also seeing great support from our suppliers and our partners around the world that are also interested in driving their business and using Costco as that partner to get that done.\" Member demographics were a bright spot on the call. About half of new members in fiscal 2024 were under the age of 40, finance chief Millerchip said. \"This percentage has been growing since Covid-19 and has lowered the average age of our member over the last few years.\" The younger Costco can capture a new member, the better chance it has at keeping that member's loyalty over time. COST YTD mountain Costco's year-to-date stock performance. Costco shares aren't cheap  a fact that motivated a recent analyst downgrade  but we continue to see further upside ahead. The reason is simple: Consumers will keep flocking to Costco in search of value, and investors will in turn continue to reward management's ability to drive customer loyalty with a premium price-to-earnings multiple. Plus, the benefit from slightly higher membership fees haven't flowed into the business yet. Put it all together, we're increasing our price target on the stock to $950 a share from $875. We are keeping our 2 rating on the stock for the time being, meaning we'd wait for pullbacks before buying additional shares. Quarterly commentary Costco's fourth-quarter gross margins of 11% edged out the Wall Street estimate of 10.94%, up 39 basis points on a reported basis and 33 basis points when excluding gas inflation. Both figures are worth highlighting, but the ex-gas number offers a better look at Costco's underlying fundamentals given price of oil is out of management's can control. A basis point equals 0.01%. Core merchandise was a five basis point headwind to Costco's gross margins on a reported basis, while its 2% reward program for certain members was a four basis point headwind. However, this was more than offset by a 44 basis point improvement in Costco's ancillary and other businesses  including gas stations, pharmacies, food courts, travel and hearing aid centers. And finally, last in, first out (LIFO) inventory accounting was a five basis point tailwind. Adjusted same store sales growth of 6.9% outpaced expectations, as an increase in traffic was only partially offset by a small decrease in average ticket price. The supply chain was a topic of conversation on the call, with management noting that the Red Sea remains a pain point (remember, shipping containers in that area had to deal with Houthi rebel attacks from Yemen). While any further disruptions could increase ocean freight rates down the line, employees have done a very good job insulating the company from the recent price increases \"with good solid contracts for this year.\" Moreover, executives said spot prices  what they'd pay if they were to sign contracts now  appear to have peaked and are starting to come back down. The current inflation dynamic is similar to what we saw last quarter, according to management. A slight increase in the price of food and sundries was offset by a decrease in the price of nonfoods, resulting in roughly zero overall inflation. Thursday marked Costco's first conference call since the long-awaited membership fee hike became a reality. While it's too early to determine the impact, we continue to expect little resistance from members because of the incredible value Costco provides. That's especially true when it comes to the Kirkland Signature brand, which is still growing faster than the business as a whole. Millerchip ticked off many examples of Kirkland Signature products that saw price reductions in the quarter, such as macadamia nuts, a three-liter bottle of Spanish olive oil and two-pack baguettes. Additionally, the finance chief said Costco's \"commitment to sustainability\" has led to some product packaging redesigns that use less plastic, giving the team an opportunity to cut prices. Laundry packs are one example where this happen, Millerchip said, going to $18.99 from $19.99. In other words, not only are we seeing disinflation at Costco, where the rate of price increases are slowing, we're actually seeing several examples of deflation, which means prices actually come down. In the quarter, Costco's membership renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada came in at 92.9%, a tick lower than the 93% rate observed in the third fiscal quarter, while worldwide held constant at 90.5%. Millerchip attributed the slight declines in U.S. and Canada renewals to online membership promotion that ran for a short time in 2023 that resulted in 200,000 new sign-ups at the time. \"As those members entered the renewal rate calculation during Q4 fiscal year 2024, the lower renewal rate for that cohort, which is typical for digital promotions, had a negative impact on the overall U.S renewal rate. Outside of those sign-ups, there were no meaningful changes in the U.S renewal rate.\" Costco's warehouse expansion resulted in 29 net new locations in fiscal 2024, including the opening of it's first location in Maine, which brought the company's U.S. presence to 47 states. Management expects to add another 26 net new buildings in fiscal 2025, with 12 of those locations being outside of the U.S. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long COST.

        "content": "MicronTechnology  shares surged roughly 14% in after-hours trading after the memory maker forecast higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue due to the thirst for its memory chips used in artificial intelligence computing. Micron is one of the only three providers of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips along with South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung, which has allowed the U.S. firm to cash in on demand for semiconductors that help power generative AI technology. HBM is a space-saving, power-efficient type of dynamic random access memory chip, or DRAM, crucial for AI-focused graphics processing units, that aid in processing vast amounts of data. \"Demand from data center customers continues to be strong and customer inventory levels are healthy,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on a conference call with analysts. The company said in June its HBM chips, used in the AI processors designed by Wall Street darling Nvidia, were sold out for the 2024 and 2025 calendar years with pricing already determined. Micron expects to report record revenue of about $8.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, in the first quarter and forecast a jump in gross margin to about 39.5% for the same period. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.28 billion for the first quarter and adjusted gross margin of 37.7%, according to LSEG data. The AI boom has also helped Micron cushion the hit from a memory chip inventory glut in PC and smartphone markets. Personal computers infused with AI technologies are expected to have more memory chips, helping firms such as Micron. AI PCs may have over 30% more DRAM and Microsoft's push to have users shifting to Windows 11 from an older version, may expand the market, especially for commercial PCs in 2025, said Summit Insights senior research analyst Kinngai Chan. Micron's results typically set the tone for the chip sector as it reports ahead of peers and serves a broad client base spanning the PC, data center and smartphone industries. \"HBM, high capacity memory and data center flash storage, each of these three product categories will be multiple billions of dollars in revenue in 2025,\" Micron's Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana said. For the first quarter, the company forecast an adjusted profit of $1.74 per share, plus or minus 8 cents, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.65."

        "content": "Shares of  H&M  tumbled as much as 8% on Thursday after the world's second-largest listed fashion retailer posted a miss on operating profit and abandoned its earnings margin target. The Swedish clothing retailer  reported  that operating profit for the group's fiscal third quarter came in at 3.51 billion Swedish crowns ($345.8 million), which compared to 4.74 billion Swedish crowns a year ago. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had forecast operating profit of 4.93 billion, Reuters reported. H&M dropped its earnings margin target for 2024 after  warning  of more challenging conditions earlier in the year. The move is seen as likely to increase the pressure on CEO Daniel Ervr, who has been in the role for just eight months. On succeeding Helena Helmersson in late January, Ervr  pledged  \"to create unbeatable value for our customers and profitable growth.\" H&M has struggled to boost its profitability in recent months, with cooler weather, higher living costs and a slowdown in post-pandemic spending hampering both high street and luxury retail sales. The retailer is also facing stiff competition from the likes of Zara owner Inditex and fast-fashion retailer Shein. \"External factors have impacted our sales revenue and purchasing costs more than we expected. At present we estimate that this year's operating margin will be lower than 10 percent,\" H&M's Ervr said in a written statement. \"We are confident that our plan will contribute to increased sales and profitability,\" he added. Shares of H&M fell on the news, down 4% at around 9:40 a.m. London time. The Stockholm-listed firm was among the worst-performing stocks on the pan-European Stoxx 600 during morning trading. Analysts at UBS said in a research note that some of the most noteworthy areas of H&M's results included bumper sales in local currencies, an increase to the cost of the firm's markdowns and the retailer's plan to reduce its net store count. H&M said the cost of markdowns in relation to sales was expected to \"increase somewhat\" in the fourth quarter."

        "content": "FedEx  reported a steep quarterly profit drop and lowered its full-year revenue forecast on Thursday after its customers continued to trade down from speedy, pricey delivery to cheaper, slower options. Shares in the Memphis-based delivery giant tumbled almost 11% to $267.74 in after-hours trading, dragging shares in rival  United Parcel Service  down 2.5%. The shift to less-profitable packages is squeezing profits at FedEx and UPS. While the latter pinned the blame on a flood of volume from China-linked e-commerce players that Reuters identified as Temu and Shein, FedEx pointed to a drop in priority shipments between businesses. CEO Raj Subramaniam said industrial demand was softer than expected. Shipments between manufacturers and other companies in that segment are the most profitable for FedEx, which is often seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy. \"The magnitude of the Fed rate cuts yesterday signals the weakness of the current environment,\" Subramaniam said, referring to the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by half of a percentage point on Wednesday. Subramaniam is leading a complex restructuring at FedEx that involves slashing billions of dollars in overheads and merging its separate Ground and Express delivery units. Cost cuts failed to offset the drag from weak demand for lucrative priority services and one fewer operating day in the latest quarter, FedEx said. The company now expects revenue for fiscal 2025 to grow by a low single-digit percentage. It previously called for low-to-mid single-digit percentage growth. FedEx also lowered the top end of its full-year adjusted operating income to between $20 and $21 per share, versus its previous range of $20 to $22 per share. On an adjusted basis, profit fell to $3.60 per share from $4.55 per share a year ago. FedEx is winding down contract work for the United States Postal Service, its largest customer, and expects a $500 million headwind from the loss of the contract in the current fiscal year. FedEx's unprofitable USPS air contract, which accounted for about $1.75 billion in revenue to FedEx during the postal service's latest fiscal year, will end on Sept. 29. UPS picked up that business. Executives are also assessing whether to spin off or sell its FedEx Freight business."

        "content": "Darden Restaurants  on Thursday reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue as sales weakened at Olive Garden and its fine dining restaurants. \"While we fell short of our expectations for the first quarter, I firmly believe in the strength of our business,\" CEO Rick Cardenas said in a statement. \"I am confident in the actions all our brand teams are taking to address their guests' needs, which do not compromise the long-term health of our business for short-term benefits.\" The company shared a number of initiatives that it's implementing to boost sales, including its first partnership with Uber, ending its resistance to third-party delivery. Shares of the company closed Thursday up 8%. Excluding Thursday's gains, the stock has fallen 3% this year as investor concerns about the health of the consumer weigh on the restaurant industry at large. Here's what the company reported for the quarter ended Aug. 25 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Darden reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $207.2 million, or $1.74 per share, up from $194.5 million, or $1.59 per share, a year earlier. Excluding costs related to its  purchase of Tex-Mex chain  Chuy's, the restaurant company earned $1.75 per share. Net sales  rose 1% to $2.76 billion, but the company's same-store sales declined 1.1% in the quarter. Traffic to its restaurants fell sharply in July but then improved, according to CFO Raj Vennam. Executives at other restaurant companies have also said that traffic struggled this summer, chalking it up to increased travel or diners growing even more cautious. Olive Garden's same-store sales shrank 2.9% in the quarter. The chain is reviving its Never Ending Pasta Bowl later this month in the hopes of bringing back customers. Olive Garden is running the promotion about a month earlier than usual and extending it for three weeks longer than last year. Darden is also looking to Uber to boost its sales. The two-year, exclusive deal will start with a pilot at select Olive Garden restaurants. Unlike many chains, Darden rejected third-party delivery companies even during pandemic lockdowns and instead chose to use its own employees to deliver meals to diners. It's too early to tell if delivery will lift sales significantly for Darden. \"Our gut reaction is given the brand skews to a more mature customer base & is known more for hospitality than off-premise, we do not expect as material a sales lift vs other concepts launching third-party delivery,\" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Darden's fine dining segment, which includes Eddie V's and The Capital Grille, reported same-store sales declines of 6%. \"It seems like there were other places where the luxury consumer was spending dollars, especially this summer,\" Cardenas said, adding that the company is seeing a pullback from consumers who make as much as $200,000. LongHorn Steakhouse was the company's only division to report same-store sales growth. The chain, a top performer in Darden's portfolio since the pandemic, saw same-store sales growth of 3.7%. Cardenas said that consumers are trading down from fine-dining restaurants into LongHorn's steaks. Darden bought Chuy's Holdings in July for roughly $605 million, its second acquisition in two years.   The company expects the Chuy's deal to close in its fiscal second quarter, which is also when Ruth's Chris Steak House's results will appear in its same-store sales numbers. Darden bought Ruth's Chris a little over a year ago. Despite the gloomy quarter, Darden reiterated its full-year outlook. For fiscal 2025, the company is forecasting earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.40 to $9.60 and net sales of $11.8 billion to $11.9 billion. To date, Darden's fiscal second-quarter same-store sales are growing, a promising sign that this summer's slump could just be a blip, Cardenas said."

Constellation Brands Why we own it : Constellation Brands' beer franchise, which includes popular Mexican brands Modelo, Corona and Pacifico, is the growth engine and by far the most attractive part of the business. We continue to urge Constellation to concentrate on beer and divest its struggling wine-and-spirits unit. Competitors : Anheuser-Busch Inbev and Molson Coors Weight in Club portfolio : 2.74% Most recent buy : July 29, 2024 Initiated: May 5, 2022 Bottom line Constellation Brands delivered no real surprises Thursday  but that was to be expected after the Mexican beer importer revised its full-year guidance a month ago due largely to steeper declines in wine and spirits than previously expected. The range for full-year growth expectations for beer was moderated slightly  to 7% at the midpoint from 8%. Investors greeted that revised guidance in early September with a sigh of relief. That's because third-party data sources were signaling a cruel summer for the beverage category as a whole, which led analysts to lower their estimates before Constellation said anything. Now investors were greeting Thursday's results with some selling. Shares fell roughly 4% on Thursday, after climbing more than 6% from Aug. 30  the session before the outlook change  through Wednesday's close. The S & P 500 advanced just 1% over the same stretch. In its fiscal second quarter, Constellation's portfolio of imported Mexican beers continued to grow, albeit at slightly slower pace than the market has become to expect. Sales were up 6% from a year ago, compared with year-over-year gains of 8%, 11% and 11.8% in its three prior quarters. We don't see the near-term moderation as a cause for concern. For starters, Constellation's customers are facing the same macroeconomic pressures weighing on all consumer-facing companies right now. In fact, Constellation is feeling it in a distinct way due to its sizable exposure to Hispanic consumers at a time when the Hispanic unemployment rate is above the national average . Another reason is that demand trends are improving, CEO Bill Newlands asserted on the post-earnings call  pointing to third-party scanner numbers in recent weeks that are not reflected in Thursday's reported results. \"We don't see this as any radical change in the long-term perspective on the business. It is purely a near-term issue,\" Newlands added, predicting that the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut should help stabilize the employment picture and improve consumer spending. And, the profitability of its beer business  operating margins were an impressive 42.6% in the quarter  puts Constellation in a position of strength. Indeed, Newlands said Constellation is ramping up its marketing spending in the third and fourth quarters to help fuel more demand for its largest beer brands. \"You may have noticed against the football schedule that you kind of can't miss our brands if you happen to watch any football, whether it be college football or National Football League. So we're going to continue to do that because of the tremendous work that's been done around cost and operational efficiencies,\" Newlands said. STZ YTD mountain Constellation Brands' year-to-date stock performance. Constellation's wine-and-spirits division  home to brands such as Kim Crawford and Meiomi wines and Svedka vodka  remains a thorn in the company's side, with sales and operating income both down double-digit percentages in the June-to-August period. We continue to wish that Constellation would sell this struggling business  but at this point, it doesn't seem imminent. On the earnings call, Newlands actually talked about some \"green shoots\" in its larger, higher-end wine brands including Meiomi, driven by strategic pricing and marketing initiatives in certain markets. Constellation is sustaining those efforts in the second half of the year, Newlands said, with the expectation that they will help drive sequential improvements in the segment in the third and fourth quarters. We'll believe it when we see it, considering the unit's prolonged struggles. Even if Newlands' case for improvement comes to fruition, Constellation's much larger beer unit will continue to be the main growth engine. Still, raising an anchor is always welcome news, and talk of its booming beer business would, at last, no longer need the wine-and-spirits caveat. We're reiterating our buy-equivalent 1 rating and price target of $300 per share on Constellation's stock. Looking ahead, its beer business should continue grabbing market share and its hard to imagine the wine-and-spirits unit getting much worse. There's also an emerging capital-return story, especially with the company bringing its debt down to meet previously stated goals. Constellation has plenty of firepower for buybacks with $2.2 billion left on its current authorization, and its free cash flow  the source of money for repurchases  is on track to get even better once the company finishes building a new brewery to meet demand. Constellation stepped up the pace of buybacks in the second quarter, repurchasing roughly $250 million worth of stock in the period. That's up from $200 million in the first quarter. Quarterly commentary Sales in Constellation's wine-and-spirits division fell 12.5% on an annual basis to $388.7 million and missed estimates of $413.6 million, according to the Bloomberg consensus. Operating income of $70.5 million beat estimates by $6.6 million but was down about 13% year over year. Operating margin for the segment came in better than expected at 18.1%. While margins were roughly in line with the year-ago period, they were up on a sequential basis from 15.3% in the first quarter. The company said product mix changes and lower volumes were offset by lower expenses and higher contractual distributor payments. Shipment volumes dropped 9.8%, worse than expected and steeper than the 5.1% drop seen in the first quarter. The business \"continues to face challenging market conditions,\" the company said in a press release, \"primarily in the U.S. wholesale channel across most price segments in the wine category.\" Depletions  which measures the number of cases sold to retailers by a distributor  tumbled 17.6% compared with the year-ago period. In search of a bright spot, the company highlighted that its smaller craft spirits portfolio saw depletion growth of 1.3%, driven by strength in the Mi Campo tequila and Nelson's Green Brier whiskey brands. The beer segment continues to do the heavy lifting  and that might even be understating it. Sales rose 6% year over year to $2.53 billion, effectively matching the Bloomberg estimate of $2.52 billion. Operating income came rose 13% on annual basis to $1.78 billion, above expectations of $1.025 billion. Operating margin of 42.6% was arguably the most impressive line in the report, topping analyst projections of 40.6% and expanding from 40.7% in the first quarter. Cost-saving initiatives and favorable pricing were among the drivers of the strong margin performance, according to Constellation. Shipment volumes grew 4.6%, a touch above the Bloomberg estimate of 4.19%. Depletion growth was 2.4%, including one fewer selling day in the quarter, missing estimates of 4.8%. Still, Constellation saw demand growth for Modelo Especial, which was up 5%, and Pacifico, which jumped 23%, likely a sign that its popularity continues to pick up steam in markets outside the West Coast . Corona Extra depletions were down 3% in the quarter. Its beer business was the No. 1 share gainer in the category during the quarter and in the top three for the entire beverage industry, Constellation said, citing third-party data. Guidance Constellation's fiscal 2025 guidance is unchanged from the big revision a month ago . Its adjusted EPS range is $13.60 to $13.80, which excludes the previously announced write-off of up to $2.5 billion for its wine-and-spirits business. Sales declines of 4% to 6% are expected in wine and spirits. Meanwhile, the beer unit is projected to see net sales growth of 6% to 8%. Adjusted operating income growth, which also excludes the write-off, is expected to grow between 8% and 9%. Full-year free cash flow is expected in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.

        "header": "We ranked the latest earnings reports from 30 portfolio stocks from great to ugly",
        "content": "It was a solid quarter for the companies in our stock portfolio, with the bulk of our names reporting what we felt were good-to-great earnings reports. Continued economic growth on the back of a resilient consumer and increasing business confidence ahead of what most expect to be a lower interest rate environment helped drive the results. Our companies' performances were reflective of the S & P 500 firms in aggregate: 81% of technology companies beat sales estimates for the second quarter, followed by health care 79% and financials 61%, according to FactSet data. Health care at 87% and industrials at 82% were sector leaders in bottom-line beats. Methodology With the latest earnings season largely in the rearview, these second-quarter report cards are not the end-all, be-all for analysis. After all, we've only got about two weeks left in the third quarter. Nonetheless, we believe stock prices ultimately follow the underlying business fundamentals of companies. So, having an idea of which companies did well and which ones did not can help when thinking about which stocks to pick first in a pullback or let go of in a broad-based rally. With the latest earnings season largely in the rearview, these second-quarter report cards are not the end-all, be-all for analysis. After all, we've only got about two weeks left in the third quarter. Nonetheless, we believe stock prices ultimately follow the underlying business fundamentals of companies. So, having an idea of which companies did well and which ones did not can help when thinking about which stocks to pick first in a pullback or let go of in a broad-based rally. Similar to prior quarters, we grouped company results into one of four categories. The companies in each category are listed in alphabetical order. The Great The Good The Not So Bad The Ugly Home Depot is not listed below because we did notown the name before the company's earnings release. With the Fed widely expected to cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting, we opted to initiate a position in Home Depot to increase our exposure to quality companies that have been held down in this high interest rate environment but will see their industries improve as rates come down. Costco is also not included as the company has yet to report results. We will circle back and add Costco when the numbers are out toward the end of the month. Here is our ranking of earnings from 30 out of our 32 companies. The Great Apple : Despite all the worries about China, the consumer tech giant hit back with beats on the top and bottom lines. Equally important, total revenue guidance and management's services growth forecast for the current quarter outpaced expectations. Advanced Micro Devices : In addition to exceeding expectations for both sales and earnings, management provided a positive outlook for the current quarter and sounded upbeat about AI chip demand. While MI300 chip supply continues to improve, CEO Lisa Su noted her expectation for supply to remain tight through 2025. On the PC front, she continues to think that new AI-enabled PC along with general refresh demand given how far removed we are from the last refresh cycle, during Covid, will result in strong demand for the company's new \"Zen 5\" processors. Best Buy : Strong execution resulted in a top and bottom line beat versus expectations while the promise of wider adoption of AI devices and PCs as well as upcoming lower interest rates provided management the opportunity to raise full year guidance. Salesforce : The enterprise software giant beat sales and earnings expectations in the second quarter. The company may have maintained its full-year revenue outlook, but that was taken as good enough after last quarter's debacle. Plus, an increase to its margin forecast showed Salesforce remains committed to profitable growth. DuPont : It was another beat-and-raise quarter , continuing a recovery partly driven by growing demand for AI chips  and rewarding our patience with the stock. DuPont has turned the corner, and now it is hitting full stride on its recovery. Danaher : The life sciences company delivered a strong quarter and reaffirmed its guidance  signaling the longtime Club stock is back on track.This quarter was exactly what we needed to see. In addition to strong performance at the companywide level  with profit margins and cash flow generation complementing the strength in sales and earnings  bioprocessing demand is improving as end-market inventory and funding continue to normalize. Dover : The company delivered better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and raised its full-year guidance  an all-around strong report that validates our decision to take a stake in the industrial name two months ago. Eaton : The momentum on display in Eaton's quarterly results and in management's outlook is showing no signs of slowing down. Segment profit margin and organic sales growth topped estimates. Management also raised its outlook for the year. In addition to industrial applications, both Eaton and Dover are beneficiaries of the AI-driven data center buildouts for the parts and systems they make. Eli Lilly : It was a home-run quarter fueled by sales of its blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs, quieting any lingering investor concerns in the stock.Eli Lilly not only crushed estimates on all the most important items  profits and sales of diabetes treatment Mounjaro and weight loss drug Zepbound  but the company also hiked its full-year guidance for revenue, earnings and gross margin. Meta Platforms : Management delivered better than expected quarterly results, delivering revenue at the high end of guidance thanks to a roughly 22% increase in advertising dollars. While there are still concerns about the company's aggressive AI spending, we believe these investments will pay off in the long run. Nvidia : The results , the guide and everything we heard on the call served only to increase our conviction that Nvidia really is the greatest semiconductor company in the world at the heart or the accelerated computing megatrend. Palo Alto Networks : Quarterly results were strong, and all signs point to continued growth ahead. While product sales performance did come up a bit light, the weakness was more than offset by strength in the company's subscription and support offerings. Companywide gross income and operating income were all ahead of expectations. Management also provided a better-than-expected sales, earnings, and recurring revenue outlook. Stanley Black & Decker : Delivered solid quarterly results  enhanced by strong cash flow performance, allowing management to raise its full-year guidance. Like Best Buy, Stanley is a stock that will benefit from lower borrowing costs. The Good Abbott Laboratories : Sales, earnings and organic growth all exceeded analyst estimates. Unfortunately, that was overshadowed by softer than expected guidance for the current quarter. That said, we think management's upward revision to the full year forecast, for both organic revenue growth and earnings are where investors should focus. Broadcom : Sales and earnings outpaced expectations , driven by strong sales of its AI products and VMware software. But management's guidance for the current quarter disappointed investors, keeping this from being an outright great quarter. Disney : Concerns about attendance at its theme parks overshadowed streaming profits and better-than-expected headline results . However, the quarter checked the boxes that matter most to us. Alphabet : Delivered largely better-than expected earnings results that showed the search and cloud giant is finally on better footing in the fast-growing AI space. Linde : It was another impressive quarter , as the industrial gas supplier continues to demonstrate its reliability and value in a diversified stock portfolio. Morgan Stanley : It was a pretty strong quarter overall. In addition to the revenue and earnings beats, Morgan Stanley put up better-than-expected results on nearly all key firmwide metrics. Unfortunately, results came up short in both the Wealth Management and Investment Management segments. Microsoft : In addition to fiscal Q4 sales and earnings outpacing expectations, gross, operating, and net profit margins were all better than expected at the companywide level. Operating profitability was stronger than expected in all three main operating segments. Cash flow generation was also much more than expected despite slightly higher-than-expected operating expenses and capital expenditures to support the company's cloud and artificial intelligence offerings. The one major miss was at Azure, which is the one unit investors are hyper-focused on and prevents us from calling it a great quarter. Nextracker : A roughly $100 million revenue beat and healthy profits per share were not enough to satisfy investors as scrutiny of the solar company's revenue backlog came more into focus during Nextracker's conference call with analysts. It seems to be the overarching concern around the quarter. Starbucks : The quarter wasn't a great one, but expectations were low after the previous quarter, a debacle that led to a 16% plunge the next day. The two most important things Starbucks needed to do this time were show signs of improvement in North America and maintain its outlook. It delivered on both with slightly better sales and small margin compression in its largest region, while the full-year outlook was reiterated. Constellation Brands : Reported an earnings beat driven by strength in its beer business. However, investors  including us  remain troubled by continued weakness in the wines and spirits business. TJX Companies : The company's ever-increasing ability to attract deal-hungry shoppers was on display , with a 4% increase in quarterly comparable store sales entirely driven by more purchases rather than higher prices. TJX is pairing that flourishing customer appeal with its well-oiled corporate operations, enabling the company to deliver the financial results that investors have come to expect. The Not So Bad Amazon : Quarterly results were mixed as sales came up short. Nonetheless, Amazon Web Services delivered great results, hitting a $105 billion revenue run rate and with operating margins that continued to trend higher despite heavy investment to keep up with demand.On the other hand, there were misses across its e-commerce and associated businesses. We could live with that but what kept this from being a good quarter was that in addition to the mixed results, guidance for the current quarter came up short. Coterra Energy : Sales and earnings came up short ,however, production volumes and more importantly cash generation both came in ahead of expectations.In addition to the strong production and strict capital expenditures discipline, management raised their production outlook and discretionary cash flow target for the remainder of the year. GE Healthcare : It was not the best showing from GEHC. China was a key source of weakness in the quarter, and the primary factor forcing management to downwardly revise its full-year organic growth outlook. Honeywell : Strong second-quarter results were overshadowed by a mixed update to management's outlook for the remainder of the year. But we're looking through the weakness on a belief that the industrial conglomerate is heading toward a healthy 2025. Wells Fargo : The bank reported a beat on earnings but delivered softer guidance due to the uncertain economy and interest-rate environment. The Ugly Procter & Gamble : It was a messy quarter , which could give fuel to investors worried that a deterioration in the consumer would make its guidance harder to achieve. Nevertheless, P & G still fills an important role in a diversified portfolio, and its business is on solid footing. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

At an analyst meeting coinciding with the Oracle CloudWorld conference in Las Vegas, the company said it now sees at least $66 billion in fiscal 2026 revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were anticipating $64.5 billion. Oracle's good week is continuing. Shares gained around 15% the past three trading sessions and are trading at a record after the company announced quarterly results that  topped expectations . The stock is now up 55% for the year, behind only Nvidia among large-cap tech companies.  Oracle sometimes also gives guidance multiple years out. The company said on Thursday that, looking out to the 2029 fiscal year, it sees over $104 billion in revenue, along with year-over-year growth in earnings per share of 20%. \"Those numbers should not be a problem. At all,\" CEO Safra Catz said at the event. She pointed to partnerships that will allow companies to use Oracle database software through top-tier cloud providers  Amazon ,  Google  and  Microsoft . Oracle announced the Amazon relationship on Monday.  The company's cloud infrastructure revenue grew 45% in the most recent quarter, a quicker pace than at Amazon, Google or Microsoft. In addition to generating more revenue as companies move workloads to the cloud from their data centers, Oracle has a shot at growing in artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, Oracle  said  its cloud unit that competes has begun taking orders for a cluster of over 131,000 next-generation \"Blackwell\" graphics processing units from  Nvidia . As Oracle plans to expand revenue, Catz said she expects capital expenditures to double in the current 2025 fiscal year.

        "header": "These 5 portfolio stocks crushed the volatile market since our August Monthly Meeting",
        "content": "Its been a topsy-turvy stock market since the Clubs August Monthly Meeting. The S & P 500 jumped 1.8% over the period, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.1% and 0.9%, respectively.But it hasnt been a one-way climb for the stock market. Investor concerns around the longevity of the generative artificial intelligence boom , coupled with the markets sensitivity to the Federal Reserves next policy move, have caused Wall Street to seesaw in recent weeks. Case in point: On Friday, the S & P 500 wrapped up its worst week since March 2023, dragged down by a weaker-than-expected August jobs report and Nvidias big decline (though the AI chipmaker has soared this week, erasing much of those losses). Septembers rocky performance so far follows four consecutive winning months for the S & P 500. Weve taken advantage of the markets recent volatility. Since our last monthly gathering, the Club trimmed shares of Eli Lilly and Procter & Gamble and exited our position in the struggling Estee Lauder entirely. We used those funds to boost our positions in AI beneficiary Dover and clean energy play Nextracker despite the latters near-term challenges. We also initiated a stake in Home Depot on Sept. 4. The markets recent jitters have pushed money into more defensive areas as investors seek well-capitalized companies that can endure a potential recession. Just look at portfolio names like Abbott Laboratories and TJX Companies . These were two of our top performers since the August Monthly Meeting. Meanwhile, other winners such as Amazon escaped last weeks sell-off in megacap tech, while Best Buy got a boost on a strong quarterly earnings report. Advanced Micro Devices joined the gainers list late Wednesday on a bounce back in chip stocks. Heres a breakdown of what drove gains in each of these five stocks since the close of the Clubs August 14 meeting through Wednesdays close. 1. Best Buy: up 17.7% Shares got a boost Aug. 23 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered dovish policy remarks at the central banks annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Best Buy can benefit from rate cuts because lower borrowing costs leads to more activity in the housing sector, which can increase demand for the companys offerings like televisions and appliances. We capitalized on the move higher, making a small sale on Aug. 26 to protect against any disappointment at its upcoming earnings report. It did not disappoint. Indeed, most of the stocks whopping double-digit advance came from the electronics retailers beat-and-raise quarter on Aug. 29 . Shares jumped more than 14% during the session.Although the stock is down roughly 3% since that initial pop, its held most of its gains on a string of positive Wall Street commentary. Bank of America, Telsey Advisory Group and DA Davidson each raised their price targets after quarterly results. We also updated our PT to $105 a share from $95. 2. Amazon: up 8.5% Shares of the e-commerce giant advanced on a string of positive Wall Street research, which added fuel to an ongoing recovery from its earnings sell-off to start last month. JPMorgan called Amazon its top internet stock pick on Aug. 19. Days later, Goldman Sachs also named the stock its top internet pick while reiterating a buy rating on shares. In the Aug. 29 note, Goldman analysts said that even if consumers trade down on their shopping choices amid economic uncertainty, the company is still well-positioned to capitalize on the shift in spending. We believe that [Amazon] sees this as an opportunity to gain market share and meet consumers with lower prices, faster delivery speeds and a widening selection, the analysts wrote, citing growth in Amazons everyday essentials businesses. The stock then faded a bit until Monday, when shares began another ascent higher after Amazons investor day, where investors celebrated CEO Andy Jassys positive remarks regarding its cloud business, and a new partnership with Oracle. 3. TJX: up 8% Similar to Best Buy, the retail stock lands on this list thanks in large part to a stellar earnings report . On Aug. 21, TJX shot up 6.1% to a record close after the company raised its fiscal 2025 profit outlook and posted a beat on the top and bottom lines. The stock has lost about 2% since then, but thats much better than the performance of a popular retail ETF over the same stretch, which lost 6.7%. TJXs relative outperformance versus other retailers came as investors looked for recession-resilient names. A bargain retailer like TJX certainly fits that bill. 4. Advanced Micro Devices: up 6.5% AMD has mounted a big rally, up 11.5% over the past three sessions alone, to land in the top five. The stock has been clobbered in recent months, including in late August into September. Now the dip buyers have come out in full force alongside some generally positive updates on AI demand. After a 2.8% jump Monday, AMD kept its run going Tuesday after a cloud computing partner, Oracle , posted upbeat quarterly results. Wednesdays strength in chip stocks, spurred by commentary from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang , likely contributed to AMDs gains in that session. The stock closed nearly 5% higher on the eve of the September Monthly Meeting. 5. Abbott Laboratories: up 6.1% The medical device maker can thank the rotation of money into defensive sectors like health care for its slow ascent higher in recent weeks. The S & P 500s health care sector is up 2.2% since the August Monthly Meeting, slightly outperforming the broad indexs 1.8% rise in that timeframe. Abbott shares have seemingly benefited from a company-specific driver, though. The stock really took off on Sept. 5 after the company launched its first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor, Lingo, in the U.S. ( See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramers Charitable Trust.)

        "content": "Goldman Sachs  will post a roughly $400 million pretax hit to third-quarter results as the bank continues to unwind its ill-fated consumer business. CEO  David Solomon  said Monday at a conference that by unloading Goldman's GM Card business, as well as a separate portfolio of loans, the bank would post a hit to revenues when it reports results next month. It is the latest turbulence related to Solomon's push into consumer retail. In late 2022, Goldman began to pivot  away  from its nascent consumer operations, beginning a  series  of write-downs related to selling chunks of the business. Goldman's credit card business, in particular its Apple Card, allowed rapid growth in retail lending, but also led to  losses  and friction with regulators. Goldman is instead focusing on asset and wealth management to help drive growth. The bank was in talks to sell the GM Card platform to  Barclays , The Wall Street Journal reported in April. Solomon also said Monday that trading revenue for the quarter was headed for a 10% decline because of a tough year-over-year comparison and difficult trading conditions in August for fixed-income markets."

        "header": "Oracle shares jump 13% on earnings and revenue beat",
        "content": "Oracle  shares rose 13% Tuesday and are on pace to close at a record after the database software vendor reported fiscal first-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates. Here is how the company did compared to LSEG consensus: Oracle's revenue increased 8% from $12.45 billion a year ago, according to a  statement . Net income rose to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $2.42 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The stock's highest close to date was $145.03 in July. Prior to the report, Oracle was up about 34% so far this year, compared to the S&P 500's 15% gain. For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 8 to 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call. Analysts were expecting growth of close to 9%, according to LSEG. The company sees adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of 1.45 to $1.49. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.47 per share. The company said its cloud services and license support business generated $10.52 billion in revenue. That was up 10% from a year earlier and higher than the StreetAccount consensus of $10.47 billion. Oracle's cloud and on-premises license segment had $870 million in revenue, up 7%, and more than StreetAccount's $757.6 billion consensus. Revenue from cloud infrastructure came to $2.2 billion, up 45%. That is an acceleration from the  previous quarter , during which revenue went up 42%. \"I will say that demand is still outstripping supply. But I can live with that,\" Catz said on the call. Oracle is currently designing a data center that will use over a gigawatt of power, and it will rely on three modular nuclear reactors, Larry Ellison, Oracle's co-founder, chairman and chief technology officer, said on the call. Over time, Oracle might operate 2,000 data centers, up from 162 today, Ellison said. But not all of them require massive amounts of power. \"The smallest are about 150 kilowatts,\" Ellison said. \"And we're going to get down to 50 kilowatts.\" During the quarter, Oracle announced the opening of a second cloud region in  Saudi Arabia  and said its database software will be available through  Google's  public cloud. In a separate statement on Monday, Oracle  said  it would partner with cloud infrastructure market leader  Amazon  Web Services to enable its database services on dedicated hardware.

        "header": "Why Broadcom stock is tumbling after an earnings beat \u2014 and how to play the dip",
        "content": "Broadcom reported an earnings beat Thursday, driven by strong sales of its AI products and VMware software. But management's guidance for the current quarter disappointed investors, sending shares of the chipmaker down nearly 7% in the after market. This is too harsh of a reaction to an otherwise solid print. Revenue increased 47% year over year to $13.07 billion, beating analysts' forecasts of $12.97 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG, formerly Refinitiv. Excluding the contribution from VMWare, Broadcom's sales rose 4% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 18% from last year to $1.24, which exceeded expectations of $1.20. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $8.22 billion in the quarter, beating the $7.8 billion predicted by Wall Street. Broadcom Why we own it : Broadcom is a high-quality semiconductor and software company run by an incredible CEO in Hock Tan, who is best known for his value-creating M & A strategy. We view Broadcom as one of the biggest AI beneficiaries through its networking and custom chip businesses. The stock trades at a much more reasonable price-to-earnings ratio relative to other chip stocks. The company also has a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy with its dividends and buybacks. Competitors : Marvell Technology, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia Last buy : Oct. 3, 2023 Initiation date : Aug. 24, 2023 Bottom line Broadcom continues to deliver on our thesis. Its AI-related business continues to grow at a fast clip and the increase to the full-year outlook further proves this is one of the best AI chip stories in the market. The VMWare integration is also performing incredibly well, but we always had little doubt since the company has an excellent track record of acquiring strong businesses that can generate both revenue and cost synergies. The only weakness in the story right now is in the legacy semiconductor business. But CEO Hock Tan said on the earnings call that in aggregate its markets have reached a bottom and are on the road to recovery. When asked about how big the recovery could be during the Q & A section, Tan sounded confident about it returning at least to prior levels. \"And like all previous cycles, my sense  is we will get up back to the level we used to be. There's no reason at all why it doesn't,\" he said about the non-AI semi business. \"And given the rate of booking  I dare say, even put a thought in your mind that as AI permeates enterprise, enterprises all across digital natives, you need to upgrade service. You need to upgrade storage. You need to upgrade networking, connectivity across the entire ecosystem,\" Tan explained. Although Tan was hesitant to provide a timing around the next upcycle, he said it could meet or even surpass prior cycles because of the storage and workload needs of AI computing. The investment thesis for Broadcom is intact: AI revenues are strong, non-AI semi revenues are mostly bottoming, and the VMWare integration is exceeding all expectations. But with the stock down more than 6% and back trading in the low $140s after what looks like to be a beatable guide, Thursday's sell-off is an opportunity to buy gradually on any additional weakness. Just leave room in the position in case volatility persists over the next month and a half. We reiterate our 1 rating and $190 price target. Quarterly commentary Semiconductor solutions revenue grew nearly 5% year over year to $7.27 billion, missing expectations, as strength in AI-related sales could not offset ongoing cyclical weakness in revenue from enterprises and telecommunications companies. AI and non-AI-networking: Total revenue increased 43% year over year to $4 billion, driven by about $3.1 billion in AI networking and custom AI accelerator sales to hyperscaler customers that are scaling up and scaling out their AI clusters. The revenue split was about one-third networking and two-thirds compute (custom silicon). Broadcom operates an Ethernet network, which differs from Nvidia's InfiniBand solutions. On the custom chip side, Broadcom said sales grew 3.5 times year over year. The company doesn't call out its customers out by name, but it's widely believed that Club names Alphabet and Meta Platforms  and more recently, TikTok parent ByteDance  are the main customers for these custom AI accelerators. Tan sees AI revenues increasing 10% sequentially to over $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The legacy semiconductor businesses were weak, perhaps more than expected given the miss in the quarter. Wireless : Revenue increased 1% year over year to $1.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, Tan said he expects revenue to surge over 20% sequentially to reflect the launch of a next-generation device from a North American customer. He is speaking, of course, about Apple ahead of its Sept. 9 event, when the company is expected to reveal its new AI-powered iPhone. Although Tan didn't budge his full-year wireless outlook of relatively flat year over year, this could be a conservative call and fiscal 2025 sales will be strong because Apple is about to embark on a big new upgrade cycle. Server and storage connectivity : Sales fell 25% year over year to $861 million. But the recovery Tan called for beginning in the second half of its fiscal year is playing out as the results improved 5% sequentially. That recovery will continue in the fourth quarter, as Tan expects revenue to grow by a mid-to-high single digit percentage sequentially and be down by a high single digit percentage year over year. Broadband : Sales remained under pressure due to a pause in telco and service provider spending, falling 49% year over year to $557 million. Tan pushed out the bottoming timeline to the beginning of 2025 from the second half of its fiscal year. Industrial : Sales fell 31% year over year for this small business but Tan said it may have hit a bottom in the third quarter. Broadcom's other segment, infrastructure software , posted revenue that beat expectations, growing 200% year over year to $5.8 billion. VMware continued its improving trend, with revenue of $3.8 billion in the quarter, up from $2.7 billion last quarter and $2.1 billion two quarters ago. Even better, in traditional Broadcom fashion, the company is reducing VMWare's associated costs. Operating expense in the quarter was $1.3 billion, down from $1.6 billion in the second quarter. With revenues growing and expenses falling, VMWare's profitability profile is significantly improving. When Broadcom first bought the business in November 2023, management set a target of $8.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA within three years of the acquisition. Tan moved up that timeline on the earnings call when he said it is on the path to achieving or exceeding this goal in the next fiscal year 2025. Capital allocation On the headline, Broadcom generated about $4.8 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, a big miss versus the consensus estimate of about $6.5 billion. However, Broadcom generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow when excluding restructuring and integration cash costs in the quarter. The company paid $1.3 billion of withholding taxes related to net settled equity awards that vested in the quarter, resulting in the elimination of 8.4 million shares. Similar to the prior quarter, there were no formal share repurchases in the quarter as part of its buyback as the company prioritizes debt reduction related to the VMware acquisition. Once Broadcom gets its debt level back toward normal levels, expect hefty buybacks. Outlook For the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024, Broadcom expects revenue to be approximately $14 billion, which is a touch lower than the Street consensus estimate of $14.1 billion. By segment, semiconductor revenue is expected to be $8 billion while infrastructure software sales are expected to be about $6 billion. The semi number is a slight miss versus expectations, and the difference is probably due to the non-AI business lines because AI sales are humming. Broadcom raised its full-year AI revenue forecast to $12 billion, up from prior guidance of over $11 billion. Although Broadcom didn't provide explicit guidance for fiscal 2025, Tan said on the call he expects AI revenues to show strong growth next year. Despite a slightly soft revenue outlook, fourth-quarter profitability looks very strong. Management guided adjusted EBITDA to approximately 64% of projected revenue, or $8.96 billion. That's a beat compared to Street estimates of $8.84 billion. Based on the third-quarter results and fourth-quarter guide, the implied full-year revenue outlook is about $51.5 billion, which is in-line with the consensus estimate and slightly above Broadcom's prior full-year outlook of $51 billion.

        "content": "Broadcom  reported fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings. Broadcom shares fell 7% in extended trading after guidance was in-line with expectations. Here is how the chipmaking conglomerate did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter that ended Aug. 4: Broadcom projects current-quarter revenue of $14 billion, versus $1.36 per share on $14.04 billion expected. Broadcom reported a net loss of $1.88 billion, or a loss of 40 cents per share, versus net income in the year-ago quarter of $6.12 billion, or $1.24 per share. The company said the net loss for the third quarter includes a one-time tax provision of $4.5 billion related to trading intellectual property rights from one company segment to another based in the U.S. as part of supply chain management. Broadcom stock is up 75% in the past year as investors have come to appreciate that the company produces several parts that are required for big data centers or can be used to create infrastructure for artificial intelligence. For example, Broadcom works on Google's TPU chip, which Apple used to  train some of its AI features . Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that the company expects to record $12 billion in sales from AI parts and custom chips in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of $11 billion. \"Broadcom's third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware,\" Tan said in a statement. The company reported $7.27 billion in semiconductor sales during the quarter, up 5% annually. It is still larger than Broadcom's infrastructure software segment, which reported $5.8 billion in sales, much of which is from the company's  VMware acquisition ."

        "header": "Dick's Sporting Goods blows past earnings estimates but issues cautious guidance ahead of 2024 election",
        "content": "Dick's Sporting Goods  on Wednesday blew past Wall Street's earnings estimates in its fiscal second quarter and while the retailer did raise its full-year guidance as a result, the new outlook fell flat up against expectations. The sporting goods store comes behind a string of other retailers that issued muted or cautious guidance for the back half of the fiscal year as companies prepare for the presidential election in November and what some fear could lead to a slowdown in consumer spending. Here's how Dick's did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 was $362 million, or $4.37 per share, compared with $244 million, or $2.82 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.47 billion, up about 8% from $3.22 billion a year earlier. Comparable sales climbed 4.5% -- ahead of the 3.6% that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. In a statement, CEO Lauren Hobart said comparable sales were driven by both transactions and tickets -- indicating more people are coming to Dick's stores and spending more while they're there. For fiscal 2024, Dick's is now expecting diluted earnings per share to be between $13.55 and $13.90, up from previous guidance of $13.35 to $13.75 per share. At the midpoint, Dick's only raised its earnings guidance by about 18 cents, even though its fiscal second-quarter earnings came in 54 cents higher than expected. At the low end, Dick's earnings guidance falls a bit short of the $13.79 that analysts had expected, according to LSEG. Dick's maintained its sales guidance of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion, which also fell flat compared with the $13.24 billion that analysts were looking for, according to LSEG. The company did raise its projections for comparable sales growth and is now expecting them to grow between 2.5% and 3.5%, up from previous guidance of 2% to 3%. The high end of the guidance is ahead of the 3% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Last week, the company disclosed in a securities filing that it was the victim of a cyberattack and \"certain confidential information\" was breached. Dick's said that it activated its \"cybersecurity response plan\" as a result and engaged with external experts to investigate and isolate the threat. In its filing, Dick's said it didn't have any knowledge of the breach disrupting business operations and based on the information it had, it didn't believe the incident was material. This time last year, Dick's  shocked investors  when it said that theft  along with  aggressive markdowns  for languishing inventory  would impact its full-year profit expectations, sending its stock down 24%. At the time, profits were down about 23% but given Wednesday's earnings beat, it appears as if those woes are now behind the company. A number of other retailers  including  Target  and  Walmart   said over the last couple of weeks that shrink, or  lost inventory  from a range of factors including theft and damage, had moderated. One of the top issues that retailers said they were facing throughout 2023, shrink appears to be in the rearview mirror for some after making investments into operations, technology and a reduction in the use of self-checkout machines. Over the last few weeks, a range of retailers put out second-quarter numbers that beat expectations but issued guidance for the last two quarters of 2024 that were either muted or poor compared with the company's performance. Retailers have been bracing themselves for the upcoming election in November and the impact it could have on consumer spending. Beyond the election, there's also uncertainties tied to the Federal Reserve's expected rate cut and the impact that could have on discretionary spending. Dick's is slated to discuss its results with analysts and share more insights on its guidance at 8 a.m. ET."

        "content": "Shares of  Dollar Tree  fell more than 22% on Wednesday after the discounter cut its full-year outlook, citing increasing pressures on middle-income and higher-income customers. The retailer said it now expects its full-year consolidated net sales outlook to range between $30.6 billion and $30.9 billion. It expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.20 to $5.60. That compares with previous guidance of $31 billion to $32 billion in net sales and $6.50 to $7 for adjusted earnings per share. In a  news release,  Chief Financial Officer Jeff Davis said the company cut the forecast to reflect softer sales and costs associated with converting 99 Cents Only stores. The company also said it has had higher expenses to reimburse, settle and litigate claims related to customer accidents and other incidents at stores. Here's how Dollar Tree did in its fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 3 compared with Wall Street expectations, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG: The 97 cents per share earnings figure excludes a 30 cents per share charge for general liability claims. Dollar Tree's report comes about a week after major rival  Dollar General  slashed its full-year sales and profit outlook , sending its shares tumbling . Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos chalked up weak sales to \"a core customer who feels financially constrained.\" Dollar stores, in particular, have felt pinched as their core customer  shoppers with lower incomes and little leftover money to spend on discretionary items  makes trade-offs after a prolonged period of pricier food and everyday costs.  Walmart  has won more business from value-conscious shoppers across incomes and newer online players, such as Temu, have also attracted customers with cheap merchandise. Dollar Tree includes two store chains, its namesake, which sells a wide variety of lower-priced items like party supplies, and Family Dollar, which carries more food. Same-store sales for the company rose by 0.7% in the quarter. At Dollar Tree, same-store sales increased by 1.3% and at Family Dollar, same-store sales fell by 0.1%. The industry metric takes out the impact of store openings and closures. On an earnings call, Davis said the company saw weaker sales, particularly on the discretionary side of the business. He said it \"reflected the increasing effect of macro pressures on the purchasing behavior of the Dollar Tree's middle- and higher-income customers.\" \"Our original second-quarter outlook did not anticipate those pressures migrating to Dollar Tree's customer base to the degree that they did,\" he said. Along with contending with inflation-stretched shoppers, Dollar Tree has faced company-specific challenges. The retailer announced in March that it  would close about 1,000 Family Dollar stores , citing market conditions and store performance. Then, in June, the company said it is considering selling the Family Dollar brand. Dollar Tree bought Family Dollar for nearly $9 billion in 2015 and since then, it's struggled to strengthen the grocery-focused chain and better compete with Dollar General. The liability claims also added to the company's challenges. On the company's earnings call, Davis said the outcome of claims, particularly older ones, \"has become increasingly challenging to predict given the higher settlement and litigation costs that have resulted from a more volatile insurance environment.\" \"The claims have continued to develop unfavorably due to the rising cost to reimburse, settle, and litigate these claims, which impacted our actuarially determined liabilities,\" he said. As of Tuesday's close, Dollar Tree's shares are down nearly 43% so far this year. The company's stock hit a 52-week low on Tuesday and closed the day at $81.65.

        "content": "MongoDB  shares jumped as much as 16% in extended trading Thursday after the database software maker reported healthy fiscal second-quarter earnings and pushed up full-year guidance. Here's how the company did against LSEG consensus: MongoDB's revenue grew 13% year over year in the quarter that ended July 31, according to a  statement . The quarter's net loss came to $54.5 million, or 74 cents per share, compared with $37.6 million, or 53 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. \"We believe we are incredibly well positioned to help customers incorporate generative AI into their business and modernize their legacy application estate,\" CEO Dev Ittycheria said in the statement. The company's Atlas cloud database service enjoyed modestly better consumption than expected, he said on a conference call with analysts. In the fiscal first quarter, Atlas consumption growth slowed as clients observed more challenging economic conditions, and usage in the fiscal second quarter implied that the climate did not change, Ittycheria said. \"We generally have not seen the macro environment impact our ability to win new business, and that was true in Q2 as well,\" Ittycheria said. \"We realized that this is different from what you hear from some other software vendors.\" On Thursday Ash Kulkarni, CEO of search software maker  Elastic , said the volume of client commitments it closed in its  fiscal first quarter  was below plan. That stock was down 23% after hours. During the MongoDB call, Ittycheria talked about helping companies migrate from Elastic products. With respect to guidance, MongoDB called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 65 cents to 68 cents per share on $493.0 million to $497.0 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected 60 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $478.8 million in revenue. Management nudged up its fiscal 2025 forecast. MongoDB now sees $2.33 to $2.47 per share in adjusted earnings, with $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion in revenue. That's up from the May guidance of $2.15to$2.30 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.88 billionto$1.90 billion in revenue. Analysts had predicted $2.26 per share in adjusted earnings, along with $1.90 billion in revenue. Excluding the after-hours move, MongoDB shares were down almost 40% on the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 17% in the same period.

        "header": "Ulta misses Wall Street expectations first time in 4 years, trims guidance after quarterly sales decline",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty  shares sank 7% in extended trading Thursday as the company fell short of second-quarter expectations and trimmed its full-year guidance after a decline in same-store sales during the most recent period. It was the company's first earnings per share miss since May 2020 and first revenue miss since December 2020. Comparable sales for the second quarter fell 1.2%, compared with an 8% increase a year earlier and well below the 1.2% growth that Wall Street analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. \"While we are encouraged by many positive indicators across our business, our second quarter performance did not meet our expectations, driven primarily by a decline in comparable store sales. We are clear about the factors that adversely impacted our store performance, and we have actions underway to address the trends,\" CEO Dave Kimbell said a press release. During the company's earnings call, Kimbell attributed the declining sales performance to four key factors, including an \"unanticipated operational disruption\" due to a change in store systems as well as disappointing impact from promotions.  The company also suffered from what Kimbell described as consumers who are increasingly cautious with their spending and from heightened competition in the beauty industry. Kimbell conceded that Ulta's market share is being challenged and said although the company maintained its share in mass beauty during the most quarter, it lost share in the prestige beauty sector driven by makeup and hair categories, according to Circana data, cited by Kimbell.  It's not uncommon for stores to experience a short-term negative sales impact due to competitors' openings or cannibalization by new Ulta beauty stores, but Kimbell said the scale and pace of change now has been unusual, adding that 80% of stores have been impacted. \"We know we're still in the midst of this...these competitive pressures will likely continue into the near term, but the positive signals...in our broader business, the guest engagement, the impact of newness, the impact of our new stores, the success of our salon business, the loyalty growth, all of those factors suggest to us and give us a lot of confidence that our business continues to have underlying strength and health,\" Kimbell said. The company now forecasts full-year same-store sales in a range of flat to 2% down, compared with prior guidance of 2% to 3% growth. \"Our updated outlook for sales assumes it will take more time for our actions to change the top line trajectory and that stores impacted by multiple competitive openings will continue to be pressured,\" CFO Paula Oyibo said. Ulta also now expects full-year revenue of $11 billion to $11.2 billion, down from previous guidance of $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, and full-year earnings per share of $22.60 to $23.50, down from a previous forecast of $25.20 to $26. Here's how the beauty retailer  performed in the period ended August 3  compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The company reported net income of $252.6 million, or $5.30 per share, compared with $300.1 million, or $6.02 per share, during the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose to $2.55 billion, up from $2.53 billion a year earlier. Earlier this month, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed  a$266 million stake  in the beauty retailer, sending Ulta shares surging. For some analysts, it was  validation  that the stock was oversold after falling 32% in 2024 up to that point, tumbling 26% in the second quarter alone. Shares of Ulta have been suffering since CEO Dave Kimbell warned of  cooling beauty  demand at an investor conference back in April. Kimbell said although a pullback was expected, it had hit the company \"a bit earlier and bit bigger\" than anticipated. During the company's first-quarter earnings call in May, Kimbell  outlined plans  to boost sales that spanned five key areas: product assortment, brand social relevance, enhancing the consumer digital experience, boosting the loyalty program and evolving the company's promotional levers. In the same call, Kimbell also said the beauty retailer later this year would be expanding its partnership with delivery service  DoorDash , would start testing new gamification platforms and would activate new marketing technology to personalize customer shopping experience. This time around, Kimbell said that executives has identified further opportunities within the attempted turnaround plan, such as relaunching Ulta's own beauty collection and introducing new personalized product recommendations for consumers online. The company is also focusing on increasing rewards program value through member-only events and exclusive member-tiered offers. Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that Ulta Beauty forecast full-year earnings per share of $22.60 to $23.50, down from a previous forecast of $25.20 to $26."

        "content": "Volvo Cars  on Thursday scaled back its margin and revenue targets, after announcing it was no longer targeting 100% all-electric vehicle sales by 2030. The Swedish automaker, which is majority-owned by China's Geely Holding, said it is now targeting a 2026 EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin goal of 7-8%, down from \"above 8%,\" due to \"increased complexity especially in relation to global trade and tariffs.\" It added that it was now seeking to \"continue outgrowing the premium car market until 2026,\" rather than sticking to its previously announced revenue target of between 500 billion Swedish kronor ($48.6 billion) and 600 billion kronor. Ever-shifting international trade disputes and tariffs have become a major headache for automakers as they navigate geopolitics between the  European Union , China and the U.S., while also seeking a competitive edge in a market dominated by the EV transition. Volvo Cars shares were 3.2% higher in early afternoon deals following a 10% decline so far this week. The firm is holding its Capital Markets Day in Gothenburg, Sweden where it is discussing its product plans for the coming years with a firm focus on shifting to electric and plug-in hybrid models. Volvo Cars has five fully-electric models on the market, along with five in development. However,  on Wednesday it revealed  that it would no longer target 100% electric vehicle sales by 2030  which it defines as \"cars with a cord\"  instead looking for a 90-100% range, allowing mild hybrid models to continue to be sold. Mild hybrids have internal combustion engines which utilize some electric assistance. Volvo cited consumer demand, a slower-than-expected rollout of charging infrastructure, a withdrawal of government incentives in some markets and uncertainty from fresh tariffs on EVs in various markets as reasons for the change. It said it remains committed to fully electric sales in the longer term \"when the market conditions are suitable.\" Numerous automakers have reported challenges related to the electric vehicle transition,  particularly from underwhelming demand . Many consumers, meanwhile, continue to complain of insufficient charging infrastructure and cite concerns about range. Volvo Cars also announced Thursday that it was  extending its partnership with U.S. chip giant  Nvidia  as it develops features including advanced driving assistance and autonomous driving. It also said it would switch to a \"single technology stack\" as it looks to bring down the costs of EV manufacturing. Figures released by Volvo Cars on Thursday showed its global sales rose 3% year-on-year in August, driven by 32% growth in Europe, as China sales tumbled 23%. Fully-electric and plug-in hybrids accounted for 25,028 of 52,944 vehicle sales  or 47%  in August 2024, with the remainder mild hybrids and vehicles with internal combustion engines. In July, the firm  reported record quarterly operating profit  of 8.2 billion Swedish kronor."

Here's how company did in its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Lululemon shares rose more than 2% in extended trading after initially falling. The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended July 28 was $393 million, or $3.15 per share, compared with $342 million, or $2.68 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.37 billion, up about 7% from $2.21 billion a year earlier. Beyond total sales, Lululemon also missed expectations on comparable sales, which grew 2%, well behind estimates of 5.9%, according to StreetAccount. Comparable sales in the Americas fell 3%. The trend doesn't appear poised to improve in the current quarter.   Lululemon said it expects sales to grow 6% to 7%, worse than the 9.2% growth that analysts had expected, according to LSEG. However, Lululemon's profit guidance is roughly in line with what Wall Street anticipated. The company said it expects third-quarter earnings per share to be between $2.68 and $2.73, compared with estimates of $2.70, according to LSEG. During the quarter, Lululemon pulled its Breezethrough leggings, launched in early July, after it received a wave of complaints about the product's unflattering fit. On a call with analysts, CEO Calvin McDonald addressed the Breezethrough launch and said it was an opportunity for the company to \"test and learn.\" He added Lululemon bought a small amount of product for the launch. \"While guests were excited by the fabric, the design didn't meet their expectations. Listening to our guests is central to who we are and how we grow our brand, and we took the right step of pausing on sales and look forward to reintroducing the fabric in the future,\" said McDonald. \"This decision had a negligible impact on our performance in this quarter.\" The botched launch came after the company struggled with other self-inflicted issues with its assortment, including not having the colors and sizes that its core customers desired, which has had an impact on sales in the U.S. During the quarter, sales grew only 1% in the Americas, the company's largest region. On the call with analysts, McDonald acknowledged Lululemon's women's business has slowed down in the U.S. He said the company has determined the \"most significant factor\" affecting the segment is a lack of new styles, which has hurt sales of bottoms and the company's online business. \"The newness that we had performed well. We simply did not have enough to inspire her to purchase,\" he said. McDonald insisted the Lululemon brand \"remains strong in the U.S. market\" and said its men's business continues to grow. \"Guests are looking for our product, coming into our stores and visiting our e-commerce sites,\" said McDonald. Lululemon's product challenges follow the departure of its longtime chief product officer, Sun Choe, who resigned in May to pursue another opportunity. At the time, the decision weighed on Lululemon's stock over concerns that Choe's department would hurt the company's ability to innovate and keep winning over customers with trendy new fits. McDonald said Lululemon had a succession plan in place at the time of Choe's departure, and said the company's global creative director, Jonathan Cheung, would report directly to McDonald and oversee product design and innovation. The company also appointed Nikki Neuburger as its new chief brand and product activation officer, overseeing merchandising, footwear and product operations. On Thursday, McDonald said he and Neuberger are \"pleased\" with the new structure, which puts design and merchandising on \"equal footing\" and \"reestablishes the healthy balance that must exist within a product organization.\" \"The teams are working well together and already in action,\" said McDonald. Like other retailers that are seeing demand slow, Lululemon appears focused on what's within its control: operations and efficiency. While the sales picture during the quarter was rougher than expected, Lululemon's profits came in higher than anticipated. Gross profit grew 9% to $1.4 billion, while its gross margin increase 0.8 percentage point to 59.6%  better than the 57.7% that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Its operating margin and operating income also increased. Sales jumped 29% in Lululemon's international markets as the company looks to China for growth. "

        "header": "Best Buy stock soars on a beat and raise. We think that's just the beginning",
        "content": "Best Buy 's quarterly beat and guidance raise on Thursday was good for a 15% pop in the stock as investors rewarded better execution and the promise of wider adoption of AI devices and lower interest rates. Revenue in the company's fiscal 2025 second quarter fell 3.1% year over year to $9.29 billion in the three months ended July 29, outpacing the $9.24 billion expected by analysts, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 rose 9.8% on an annual basis, topping the $1.16 predicted by analysts, LSEG data showed. BBY YTD mountain Best Buy YTD Thursday's advance sent Club stock Best Buy back above $100 and above our price target of $95. We continue to see further upside ahead, so we're increasing our PT to $110 per share. We are, however, keeping our 2 rating for the time being, in deference to the speed and magnitude of the stock's recovery since its swoon earlier this month. Bottom line We see four reasons to be excited about Best Buy's future: (1) improved profitability, (2) management's efforts to enhance the in-store experience, (3) signs that generative artificial intelligence will, indeed, drive upgrades of personal computers and mobile devices, and (4) our own view that big-ticket items such as TVs and appliances will get a boost from lower rates leading to more people buying homes and needing to fill them up. While bullish, we acknowledge there's still work to be done. On the call, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry, said that growth in tablets, computing, and services, was more than offset by declines in appliances, home theater, and gaming. That sluggishness in home entertainment and appliances is largely in line with what we were expecting following quarterly updates from housing-related retailers like Home Depot , Lowe's , and Williams-Sonoma . However, it's an area in which we expect to see improvement as Federal Reserve rate cuts lower mortgage rates, which will help drive new home formations. Fiscal Q2 same-store sales, or comps as they're known in retail, dropped 2.3% from the year-ago period. That was not as bad as the expected decline of 3.2% or the previous quarter's 6.1% decline. On the post-earnings conference call, management said that July comps were the best of the reported quarter and that August, the first month of the current quarter, was tracking to be about flat. The company sees comps in its fiscal third quarter declining 1%, which was slightly worse than estimates. Best Buy Why we own : We took a position in Best Buy because we believe it will prove to be a go-to destination for consumers looking to upgrade hardware, much of which was purchased during Covid, to new AI-powered devices. Computer and mobile device lifecycles tend to be about four years, which is how far removed we are from the start of the pandemic when everyone was building out their home offices. In the meantime, we're happy to stay patient as the thesis plays out thanks to a healthy annual dividend yield. Competition : Target , Walmart , Amazon , Costco Most recent buy : July 2, 2024 Initiated : March 27, 2024 Barry said that quarterly online sales held at 32% of domestic revenue, adding that \"almost 60% of our packages are delivered or available for pickup within one day, and more than 40% of our digital sales are picked up in stores by our customers.\" The omnichannel experience, which allows customers more ways to shop both online and in stores, is important because it incentivizes sign-ups for Best Buy's paid membership program while providing more ways to engage with the consumer. Management also talked about how they're working to refresh certain parts of the in-store experience to drive more engagement. \"We began in Q2 and will finish in Q3 ahead of the holiday season. Not every store will be touched in the same way, of course, but our plans include optimizing and refreshing mobile phones, headphones, smart home and digital imaging, and creating new experiences in tablets and gaming and computing monitors,\" Barry said. \"We already can see related sales improvements, particularly in monitors and digital imaging. At the same time, we are updating or creating new branded in-store experiences with our vendor partners, including GoPro , Tesla , Lovesac , Greenworks and Starlink.\" Artificial intelligence-enabled personal computers are a major watch item for us as Computing and Mobile Phones accounted for 46% of fiscal second-quarter sales. Barry said that stores' computing departments have been revamped with a focus on Microsoft 's Copilot AI assistant, adding that fully dedicated experts have been added to help educate consumers on the benefits of this new technology. The sales impact, however, remains small at the moment, which we expected. Barry said that AI-enabled PCs are an emerging technology and as such come at a higher price point. \"We are just at the beginning of the impact of AI on tech innovation and customer demand.\" The team is also now adding experts to the home theater and major appliances departments. We like this focus on increasing the presence of specialized knowledgeable sales associates. It will differentiate the in-store shopping experience from what a consumer can get online. That's an incredibly important factor for brick-and-mortar success in a world dominated by online shopping. Specialized employees are certified by department, with Barry saying that \"certified employees on average drive higher revenue per transaction and stronger overall customer experience ratings compared to non-certified employees.We are ahead of plan with more than 60% of our sales associates certified in at least two categories.\" These efforts are an addition to ongoing efforts to increase vendor-provided experts in stores. Best Buy is also leveraging generative AI to improve customer service and help \"customers quickly troubleshoot product issues, make changes to their order delivery and scheduling, and even manage their software, Geek Squad subscriptions and membership,\" Barry said. In fact, 60% of chat users are now being completely served with generative AI-powered virtual assistants. As a result of management's effort to leverage technology and improve operational efficiency, Best Buy has managed to reduce its \"cost per customer contact by more than 20%, while improving the customer experience.\" Guidance Management updated their financial outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. The revisions are mixed, but the key item was an upward revision for full-year earnings, thanks to improving profitability. On the call, Barry said, \"We continue to expect sales in our computing category and services to show growth for the year while most other categories are expected to be down for the year.We expect ongoing improvement in their trends at the high end of our annual comp sales guidance for the third quarter.\" Revenue is now expected to be between $41.3 billion and $41.9 billion, down from the prior range of $41.3 billion to $42.6 billion, and a tad below expectations of $41.75 billion, at the midpoint. Same-store sales are now expected to be down 3% to down 1.5%, also a downward revision from the down 3% to flat range previously provided. That outlook is also a bit below the -1.8% the Street was expecting. Adjusted operating margin was revised higher, with the team now expecting a result between 4.1% and 4.3%, up from the prior 3.9% to 4.1% range. That compares with estimates of 4.1% coming into the print. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected to be between $6.10 and $6.35 per share, up from the $5.75 to $6.20 per share range previously forecast, and ahead of expectations of $6.07 per share, even on the low end.

        "content": "Gap raised its full-year profit outlook on Thursday after seeing better-than-expected results at its largest brand, Old Navy. The apparel company's fiscal second quarter results were released earlier than planned after the company \"inadvertently\" posted them to its website and then removed them, a Gap spokesperson told CNBC. \"As soon as the error was caught,we notified the NYSE and trading of our stock was halted temporarily,\" the spokesperson said, adding the results were posted \"as a result of administrative error.\" Gap's stock was halted just before 10 a.m. ET. The company then released its quarterly results at 11:12 a.m. ET. Following the release, shares rose more than 2% after being halted for much of the morning. Here's what the company reported, compared with what Wall Street expected, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG: The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 nearly doubled from the year-ago period. Gap posted earnings of $206 million, or 54 cents per share, compared with $117 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.72 billion, up about 5% from $3.55 billion in the prior-year period. For the full year, Gap now expects its gross margin to be 2 percentage points higher than the uptick of at least 1.5 percentage points it had previously forecast. It also expects its operating income to grow by about 50%. It previously anticipated it would increase by slightly more than 40%. Over the last year, Gap has been working to turn around its business, reverse a sales slump and reclaim cultural relevance  under the direction of CEO Richard Dickson   the former  Mattel  executive credited with  reviving the Barbie empire . Since Dickson took over, sales have  started to turn around  at the company's four brands  Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta and its namesake banner  and the company is  finding its voice again  among its peers. Beyond sales and relevance, Gap's profits and balance sheet have also improved significantly under Dickson. The company ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, an increase of 59% compared to last year. The company's second-quarter results didn't blow away expectations, but are solid improvements from where the company was a year ago. \"We really concentrated on our strategic priorities, and the first priority has been about maintaining financial and operational rigor that is becoming, to the extent that we can define it, the fabric of how we work, and it's reinforcing better processes and cultural accountability,\" Dickson told CNBC in an interview. \"Reinvigorating our brands is enabled by financial and operational rigor, and you see it. You see it in the results, you see it in our stores. You see it on our sites,\" he added. \"We're building stronger brand identities. They're supported by trend right products,\" Dickson said. \"We're amplifying those through better storytelling. Our media mix has gotten much more innovative, and generally speaking, I'm proud of the brand's portfolio work in the context of cultural relevance.\" During the quarter, comparable sales were up 3%, in line with the 3.1% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.   Its gross margin came in better than forecast at 42.6%, ahead of the 40.8% that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Here's a closer look at how each brand performed: Sales rose 8% to $2.1 billion, with comparable sales up 5%, better than the 4.3% growth analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. The company has been working to improve its assortment and ensure that its value offering isn't just low cost but also fashionable. \"We've been dialing up, if you will, our fashion quotient,\" said Dickson. \"Besides really driving a much more disciplined approach with financial and operational rigor, we're now dialing up and seeing the results of our reinvigoration strategy.\" As consumers feel the brunt of inflation and high interest rates, many have traded down to cheaper options, and Dickson said Old Navy is seeing \"growth across all income cohorts.\" \"With a presumed flight to value, Old Navy is there with a welcome mat,\" said Dickson. \"We become the style authority and the brand in the value space, and so again, we're concentrating on our strategic approach, our strategic priorities. I think we're seeing the success of that.\" Revenue at Gap's namesake banner rose 1% to $766 million during the quarter, with comparable sales up 3%, just shy of the 3.4% uptick analysts had expected. As Dickson looks to bring cultural relevancy back to the company, it has helped the company's namesake banner grow sales, he said. Gap's elevated work-wear line has dragged on the company's overall performance. Both revenue and comparable sales were flat in the second quarter compared to last year, versus StreetAccount estimates of up 0.5%. The company said it is working to \"improve its pricing and assortment\" to turn around the brand's performance. \"In some cases, we got too ahead of ourselves, and in other cases, we could add more value orientation to drive more scale,\" Dickson said when asked what work the company is doing to improve pricing. \"Some of our new merchandising strategies include depth of product in store, finding that right mix, if you will. And last but not least, really improving fit, which is an important part of any brand, but in particular, has been a challenge in the women's space in Banana Republic, where we're really concentrating,\" he said. Sales at Gap's athleisure brand Athleta slid 1% to $388 million, with comparable sales down 4%. The results were not comparable to analyst estimates. One of Gap's strongest brands during the pandemic, Athleta had been on a downward trajectory and weighed heavily on the company's performance until it appointed former Alo Yoga president Chris Blakeslee as its CEO last summer.   Since then, Blakeslee has worked to improve Athleta's assortment and has also worked to generate more excitement at the line with product drops and collaborations with athletes. In a press release, the company said it expects Athleta to return to positive comparable sales growth for the remainder of the year."

The S & P 500 advanced 0.7% Thursday, despite tech behemoth Nvidia's post-earnings decline. Shares of the AI chipmaker tumbled 3.5% after the company handily beat estimates on the top and bottom lines Wednesday. At issue: Nvidia couldn't quite meet their analysts' lofty estimates for the company's full-year outlook on gross margins. \"This was the mortal Jensen Huang,\" Jim Cramer said of the company's chief exec. He added that his long-term thesis on the stock hasn't changed, but said investors shouldn't buy the dip quite yet. However, the Club would purchase more Dover shares if it wasn't restricted. During its post-earnings call with investors and analysts, Huang mentioned that a \"significant\" number of data center operators want to adopt liquid cooling technology for their servers. Dover, which makes thermal connectors used in the liquid cooling of data centers, should continue to benefit as Nvidia sells more GPUs to customers that utilize that technology. The stock gained 0.7% on Thursday. Salesforce shares are up more than 1% after the enterprise software company posted a better-than-expected earnings report on Wednesday evening. \"This was a really, really good quarter,\" Jim said. We were glad to see Salesforce's margin story get back on track and positive commentary around upcoming offerings like its pair of new AI tools. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long NVDA, DOV, CRM.

        "header": "American Eagle saw profits grow nearly 60% as costs come down",
        "content": "American Eagle  missed Wall Street's sales targets for a second quarter in a row on Thursday, but profit grew by nearly 60% thanks in part to lower product costs. The company's shares fell roughly 3% in early trading Thursday. Here's how the apparel company did in its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 was $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with $48.6 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $1.29 billion, up about 8% from $1.2 billion a year earlier. That sales gain would have been slimmer had it not been for a calendar shift, which positively impacted second-quarter sales by $55 million. During the quarter, American Eagle's intimates line Aerie saw revenue grow 9% while its namesake brand grew by 8%. American Eagle's gross margin came in at 38.6%  0.9 percentage point higher than the prior year and in line with what analysts had expected. The gross margin expansion was led by \"favorable product costs,\" indicating American Eagle spent less to make its assortment during the quarter. It's unclear if it lowered prices as a result. The longtime mall brand issued a better-than-expected outlook for the current quarter but its forecast was lower than anticipated for the full year, indicating the company is still bracing for a turbulent second half. For the current quarter, American Eagle expects comparable sales to grow between 3% and 4%, which is better than the 2.8% growth that analysts had expected the company to forecast, according to StreetAccount. The retailer is expecting total revenue to be flat to up slightly for the third quarter  in line with expectations, according to LSEG. For the year, the company expects comparable sales to increase approximately 4%, with total revenue up 2% to 3%, shy of what analysts had expected. Wall Street was expecting its full-year comparable sales forecast to be up 4.2% and overall sales to be up 3.5%, according to StreetAccount and LSEG. In May, Finance Chief Mike Mathias told CNBC that American Eagle is  maintaining a \"cautious\" view  for the back half of the year as it awaits interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve and prepares for \"noise\" around the upcoming presidential election. Like other retailers contending with slowing demand for discretionary items, American Eagle has looked to cut costs and boost efficiencies so it can protect profits, even if sales are sluggish. Earlier this year, it  unveiled a new strategy  to grow profits and is working to boost sales by 3% to 5% each year over the next three years and get its operating margin to about 10%. \"In all the years I've been in this business, I probably see the greatest opportunity in the history of the company,\" CEO Jay Schottenstein said on the company's earnings call on Thursday. \"From our standpoint, today, we're a $5 billion business. We think the next few years we could be a $10 billion business. And I would emphasize this: We are committed to making the investment to become that business.\" During the quarter, American Eagle made some strides in achieving that goal. It posted operating income of $101 million, an increase of 55%, while its operating margin grew 2.4 percentage points to 7.8%. Operating income would have been lower had it not been for the calendar shift, which positively impacted the metric by $20 million. Although back-to-school season has already started with a \"strong performance\" for the company, executives expect it to last into September and get a second wind after Labor Day, a trend that Matthias said the company has observed in recent years, especially in the Northeast. President and Executive Creative Officer Jennifer Foyle added that while the American Eagle brand is leaning into women's and denim categories, the brand's mainstay segment, it is also looking to expand into new trends going forward. Foyle also said the menswear business is starting to turn around. \"We are not just a one-fit brand anymore  We're making sure that we're leaning in as we go into the back half of Q3 and Q4 and we're ready to play,\" Foyle said."

        "content": "Best Buy  raised its fiscal-year profit guidance Thursday after exceeding earnings and revenue expectations for the most recent quarter. Shares of Best Buy jumped more than 15% in morning trading Thursday. The retailer now expects to see full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.10 to $6.35, up from a prior range of $5.75 to $6.20. The company, however, lowered the top end of its guidance ranges for both full-year revenue and comparable sales. \"As we look to the back half of the year, we expect our industry to continue to show increasing stabilization,\" Best Buy CFO Matt Bilunas said in the company's press release. Here's how the consumer electronics retailer did for the  period ended Aug. 3  compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The company reported net income for the quarter of $291 million, or $1.34 per share, compared with $274 million, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier. Net sales in the quarter dropped to $9.29 billion from $9.58 billion during the same period a year earlier. Comparable sales declined 2.3% during the quarter, compared with a 6.2% fall a year earlier. That drop in comparable sales was the company's best result for the metric since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, CEO Corie Barry said on the company's earnings call. Barry said the industry is returning to growth, adding that Best Buy's positioning within the sector is helping the retailer \"to capture that growth trajectory.\" Best Buy has been in the midst of  an attempted turnaround  in response to a two-year sales slump. Discretionary merchandise retailers across the board have struggled with softer consumer demand in the wake of unusually high sales throughout the Covid pandemic and as consumers pull back due to elevated inflation. As the much-awaited replacement cycle of pandemic-era tech purchases starts trickling in, the retailer is hoping to cash in through marketing and operational initiatives. Best Buy said in July that it would add trained sales teams to three key parts of its stores  computing, appliance and home theater  and kick off a marketing campaign that includes YouTube videos to draw consumer interest. The company was also  betting  on a wave of new tech gadget debuts, such as  a collection of new iPads  launched by  Apple  in May and artificial intelligence-enabled laptops  touted  by  Microsoft , to drive sales. The company on Thursday posted comparable sales growth of 6% in the domestic tablet and computing categories. However, that was \"more than offset\" by declines in appliances, home theater and gaming, executives said. Barry added that AI could continue to boost sales across categories over the next few years. \"We believe we are just at the beginning of the impact of AI on tech innovation and customer demand,\" she said. Best Buy has seen a doubling in the number of consumers choosing to trade in old electronics for new ones, which Barry said is \"another indicator that people are wanting to renew and refresh\" their current tech gadgets. \"We capitalized on demand driven by our customers' desire to replace or upgrade their products, combined with new innovation,\" Barry said during the company's earnings call. \"We see a consumer who is seeking value in sales events and one who is also willing to spend on high-price-point products when they need to or when there is new, compelling technology.\" Still, the consumer environment continues to be \"unpredictable and uneven,\" Barry said, citing the upcoming election and the holiday season. \"There's probably an even greater risk that the consumer is a little bit unsettled\" in the back half of the year, she said."

The company now expects fiscal 2024 same-store sales to be up 1.0% to 1.6%, lower than its prior outlook for a 2% to 2.7% increase. Earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of just $5.50 to $6.20, versus the prior forecast of $6.80 to $7.55 per share.

However, he also acknowledged that the company has more work to do. Dollar General has said that it needs to improve its stores and how it handles inventory to curb losses.

Nvidia reported July quarter revenue on Wednesday of more than $30 billion, up 122% year on year. It was the fourth straight quarter of triple-digit revenue growth. But as Nvidia continues its rapid expansion, the annual comparisons are getting tougher. Nvidia issued market-beating revenue guidance for its fiscal third quarter of $32.5 billion. That would imply an 80% year-on-year increase, but a slowdown from the July quarter. Meanwhile, the company said that gross margins would be in the \"mid-70% range\" for the full year. Analysts were expecting a full-year margin of 76.4%, according to StreetAccount. However,  analysts said  that Nvidia would have had to beat all expectations by a long way in order to see a pop in the stock after the numbers. The pullback in the stock on Thursday also comes after a meteoric rally, with Nvidia's shares rising more than 150% this year to date. The stock has picked up more than 750% since the start of 2023, as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom. Large technology companies have been ramping up investment and buying Nvidia's graphics processing units to train large AI models. The current fall in Nvidia's stock price also weighed on shares of semiconductor firms around the world, with big names including memory maker Samsung and chip manufacturer  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co . lower on Thursday. Nvidia addressed another concern during its earnings call  the reported delays to its next-generation Blackwell AI chip. \"In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,\" Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a call with analysts. The company also announced a  $50 billion stock buyback program .   CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report."

        "header": "Why Cramer advises against running out to buy Nvidia's post-earnings stock dip",
        "content": "Nvidia 's financials released after Wednesday's close weren't quite the $4 billion \"Triple Lindy\" of upside many investors were hoping for. But they were darn close, which avoided a feared massive sell-off in one of the three U.S. companies in the $3 trillion market cap club. Revenue for at the AI semiconductor powerhouse's fiscal 2025 second quarter jumped 122% year-over-year to $30.04 billion, well ahead of analysts' forecasts of $28.7 billion, according to data provider LSEG. While that was about a $1.3 billion beat, it was short of the $2 billion beat that Wall Street talked itself into. Adjusted earnings-per-share increased 152% to 68 cents, exceeding the LSEG-compiled consensus estimate of 64 cents. Revenue guidance for the current quarter was for a nearly $2.5 billion sequential increase. Together with the fiscal Q2 beat, we got about $2 billion out of the $4 billion. On top of the strong results, we did get the bullish long-term commentary called for in the \"Triple Lindy,\" with CEO Jensen Huang saying that \"Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\" Throw in the $50 billion buyback authorization and maybe we can call it \"Two and a half Lindy.\" NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia YTD Continuing its rough patch since its record closing high above $135 on June 18, Nvidia stock dropped more than 7 percent in after-hours trading. That, however, was not surprising to us because Jim Cramer said during Wednesday's Morning Meeting that there was a lot of \"hot money\" in the Club name waiting to get washed out. We're talking about investors who bought the stock but don't have much conviction or care for the long-term and would sell on anything short of blowout numbers. Jim doesn't see a need to step in first thing Thursday morning and buy the dip. Let the sellers finish unloading. But, for those interested in the long-term, we think Nvidia's future is as bright as ever. We are, therefore, reiterating our buy-equivalent 1 rating and $ 150-per-share price target. Bottom line In another example of just how important it is to factor in buy-side expectations when thinking about how to position into an earnings release, Nvidia's strong results and solid outlook were not able to keep the sellers away. Shares were down because expectations got out of control plain and simple. The results, the guide and everything we heard on the call served only to increase our conviction that Nvidia really is the greatest semiconductor company in the world at the heart or the accelerated computing megatrend. With the yearly gains in central processing unit (CPU) compute power far more incremental these days than back when Moore's Law was in full effect, graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated computing, which is Nvidia's specialty, is the key to everything from autonomous driving to robotics, generative AI, digital twins, computer-aided drug discovery and so much more. In addition to an overall stronger fiscal Q3 quarter guide, CFO Colette Kress said on the post-earnings call that purchases of the current Hopper chip architecture were accelerating despite customers \"gearing up to adopt Blackwell,\" the company's next-generation artificial intelligence chip platform. Based on Kress' commentary, we still don't see an air pocket in demand despite slight delays in Blackwell's launch. The CFO added that the \"Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year 2026.\" The company is already guiding for \"several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue for the fourth quarter.\" While management didn't provide an official revenue guide beyond the current quarter, we think it safe to say that as it stands now, demand will sustain into calendar year 2025. That confirms a common theme we heard when the cloud companies, which are major Nvidia customers, reported their latest financials, that the risk was underinvestment in AI hardware, not overinvestment. Cloud providers and big tech companies are in the midst of an arms race and everybody is fighting to be first or at the very least, remain relevant. They have no chance at all of doing that if they don't continue to upgrade their hardware. Are customers going to sign up or stick with Microsoft's Azure if it only offers Hopper architecture while Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud offer Blackwell when it's released? Are consumers going to keep using OpenAI's ChatGPT if it's running off Hopper while Meta Platform's Llama 3 leverages Blackwell for inferencing? They have no choice but to keep advancing and that means tapping Nvidia for the latest and greatest data center technology on the planet. Nvidia Why we own it : Nvidia's high-performance graphic processing units (GPUs) are the key driver behind the AI revolution, powering the accelerated data centers being rapidly built around the world. But this is more than just a hardware story. Through its Nvidia AI Enterprise service, Nvidia is in the process of building out a potentially massive software business. Competitors : Advanced Micro Devices and Intel Most recent buy : Aug 31, 2022 Initiation : March 2019 Software revenue also appears to be on a very strong trajectory, according to Kress. \"We expect our software, SaaS, and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year with Nvidia AI enterprise notably contributing to growth.\" That's double the $1 billion run rate at the end of the fiscal year 2024's fourth quarter. That plays into our expectation that the nascent software business is a major opportunity and key to future growth and will be supportive of the stock's valuation, given its higher margin recurring nature. It should also serve to reduce volatility throughout the business cycle, not unlike what we've seen with Apple as Services sales there have been becoming a larger share of overall sales. That buffer takes some pressure away from quarter-to-quarter iPhone performance. Kress also reiterated that health care \"is also on its way to being a multibillion-dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery.\" Quarterly commentary During Nvidia's fiscal second quarter, better-than-expected sales were driven by strength in all key segments, including a Data Center segment revenue record. The better-than-expected $26.27 billion in Data Center sales mostly came from Compute such as Hopper GPUs, while the remaining $3.67 billion came from Networking such as InfiniBand and Spectrum-X. About 45% of segment sales came from cloud service providers, including Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and over 50% came from \"consumer internet and enterprise companies,\" as generative AI, model training and inferencing continue to drive demand for Nvidia's cutting edge offerings. Management estimates that over the past four quarters, inference demand was responsible 40% of Data Center revenue. When you ask ChatGPT  or other generative AI models a question  a question, the answer you get back is inferencing at work. The model is \"inferring\" the answer to a novel question based on its training. Regarding China, Kress said, \"Data Center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our Data Center revenue. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls.We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going forward.\" World governments also continue to be a very exciting source of demand, with Kress saying during the call's Q & A that \"in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. So, more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So, yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us.\" On the call, Kress said, \"Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every auto maker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using Nvidia in their Data Centers. Automotive will drive multibillion dollar in revenue across on-prem and Cloud prem and will grow as next generation AV [autonomous vehicle] models require significantly more compute.\" Growth in the Automotive segment was driven by \"new customer ramp in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions,\" she added. Regarding robotics, an area that we think can prove to have massive upside over the next decade and one that Nvidia is uniquely equipped to tackle given the years of research and experience it has in coding the real-world laws of physics into digital simulations, Kress said, \"Boston dynamics, BYD electronics, intrinsic, Siemens, skill AI, and paradigm robotics are using the Nvidia Isaac robotics platform for autonomous robot arms and mobile robots.\" On Gaming and AI personal computers, Kress called out sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop PC sales, adding that \"demand is strong and growing in channel inventory remains healthy.\" In the Professional Visualization segment, Kress said that \"demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads.\" Digital twins continue to be a key use case as companies leverage Nvidia Omniverse to make virtual models of physical locations. \"The world's largest electronics manufacturer Foxconn is using Nvidia Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce Nvidia Blackwell systems. And several large global enterprises including Mercedes-Benz signed multiyear contracts for Nvidia Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins factories.\" Guidance Taking a closer look at guidance, Nvidia's fiscal third quarter may not have beaten the Street's estimates by the magnitude some were hoping for, but it's far from disappointing. Revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, was above consensus of $31.77 billion. Adjusted gross margins are expected to be 75%, plus or minus 50 basis points, a tad below estimates of 75.5%, at the midpoint and below the in-line 75.7% in fiscal Q2. Expectations for adjusted operating expenses in the fiscal third quarter appear to be in line with expectations at about $3 billion.

News that Laurene Powell Jobs is investing in a new artificial intelligence \"computing device\" highlights her growing appetite for AI startups, according to fresh data. Emerson Collective, Powell Jobs' family office, investment company and philanthropy, has invested in at least nine AI-related startups since 2022, according to data provided exclusively to CNBC by Fintrx, the private wealth intelligence platform. Emerson's AI bets span the globe and the industry, including a New York-based AI medical company, a San Jose, California-based image analyzer, a French developer of large language models and a Norwegian creator of AI presentations used by teachers. The dollar amounts of Emerson's AI investments aren't disclosed. According to Fintrx, Emerson Collective has participated in AI funding rounds totaling more than $1 billion. A representative for Emerson Collective declined to comment. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  Emerson doesn't disclose its total assets under management. Powell Jobs, the philanthropist, investor and widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, has a net worth of $11.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Emerson is mainly focused on education, the environment and health care. According to Finxtrx, Emerson has made over 130 investments in total, with more than half in technology, 48 in health care and life sciences, and the rest in energy, agriculture, education and human services, media, and other categories. Raffi Krikorian, former executive at Uber and Twitter, is Emerson's chief technology officer. The New York Times reported this week  that Jony Ive, the celebrated Apple designer who worked closely with Steve Jobs and left the company in 2019, is teaming up with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to create a new \"computing device\" for using AI. Their venture aims to raise up to $1 billion by the end of the year, and Emerson Collective is one of its founding investors along with Ive, according to the report. AI has become the most popular investment theme for family offices in 2024. According to the UBS Global Family Office Report, 78% of family offices surveyed plan to invest in AI in the next two to three years  the most for any investment category. Powell Jobs started investing in AI even before OpenAI launched ChatGPT, which kicked off the current AI investment and consumer craze. In June 2022, Emerson invested in an $80 million C-round investment in Proximie, a health tech company whose platform is used to connect operating rooms. In August 2022, it invested in a $14 million Series A round for Atropos Health, which provides physicians with clinical data. Emerson went on to invest in AI startups around the world, including a $4.6 million seed round for Norway's Curipod, which helps teachers create interactive lessons, and a $415 million Series A round for Mistral, the French maker of large language models. Emerson's two most recent AI investments are Formation Bio, an AI pharma company, which raised $372 million in June, and a $33 million follow-on round for Atropos. Correction: This article has been updated to correct the number of artificial intelligence startups that Laurene Powell Jobs' family office, Emerson Collective, has invested in since 2022."

        "content": "A majority of millionaire investors said they plan to vote for Vice President  Kamala Harris  in November, even though they give former President  Donald Trump  a better grade on the economy, according to new survey. According to a UBS survey of investors with at least $1 million of investible assets, 57% plan to vote for Harris and 43% plan to vote for Trump. Harris wins 91% of Democratic millionaires surveyed, 12% of Republicans and 60% of independents. Trump wins 88% of Republican millionaires, 9% of Democrats and 40% of independents. Like many voters, millionaire investors rated the economy as their No. 1 issue. Fully 84% said the economy is the top issue in the election, followed by Social Security (71%), then taxes (69%) and immigration. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  While they support Harris more broadly, the investors who were surveyed give Trump slightly higher marks on the economy and taxes. When asked \"who is better equipped to address the economy,\" 51% said Trump and 49% said Harris. Trump also edged out Harris on taxes, at 52% to 48%. Trump has proposed extending the 2017  tax cuts  entirely, while Harriswants them to apply only tothose making less than $400,000. She has also proposed higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Millionaire investors give Harris better grades on Social Security and health care. Whoever wins, however, millionaire investors are bullish on the economy and markets. A majority (55%) said they are highly confident about the economy, up from 43% during the same period in the 2020 election cycle (which was during the Covid-19 pandemic). Three-quarters of investors are also \"highly optimistic\" about their portfolio returns in the next six months. More than three-quarters of wealthy investors are also planning to make changes to their portfolios based on the election results. If Trump wins, they said defense and energy stocks look attractive, but if Harris wins, they said health-care, sustainable investing and tech names look best, according to the survey. The survey polled 971 investors with at least $1 million in investible assets between Aug. 13 and Aug. 19."

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Family offices are the most bullish they've been in years, putting their cash to work in stocks and alternatives as the Fed starts to cut interest rates, according to a new survey. Nearly all family offices, 97%, expect positive returns this year, and nearly half expect double-digit gains, according to Citi Private Bank's 2024 Global Family Office Survey. \"This is the most optimistic outlook we've seen,\" said Hannes Hofmann, head of the family office group at Citi Private Bank, which has been conducting the survey for five years. \"What we're clearly seeing is an increase in risk appetite.\" The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  The survey is the latest sign that family offices  the private investment arms of wealthy families  are emerging from two years of hoarding cash and bracing for recession to start making more aggressive bets on market and valuation growth. They especially like private equity. Nearly half, 47%, of family offices surveyed say they plan to increase their allocation to direct private equity in the next 12 months, the largest share for any investment category. Only 11% plan to reduce their PE holdings. Private equity funds ranked second, with 41% planning to increase their allocation. With interest rates heading down, family offices are also regaining their appetite for stocks. More than a third, 39%, of family offices plan to increase their allocation to developed-market equities, mainly the U.S., while only 9% plan to trim their equity exposure. That comes after 43% of family offices increased their exposure to public stocks last year. Public equities remain their largest holding by major asset class, with stocks making up 28% of their typical portfolio  up from 22% last year, according to the survey. \"Family offices are taking money out of cash, and they've put money into public equities, private equity, direct investments and also fixed income,\" Hofmann said. \"But primarily it's going into risk-on investing. That is a very significant development.\" Fixed income has become another favorite of family offices, as rates start to decline. Half of family offices surveyed added to their fixed-income exposure last year  the largest of any category  and a third plan to add even more to their fixed-income holdings this year. With the  S&P 500  up nearly 20% so far this year, family offices are looking for 2024 to end with strong returns. Nearly half, 43%, expect returns of more than 10% this year. More than 1 in 10 large family offices  those with over $500 million in assets  are banking on returns of more than 15% this year. There are risks to their optimism, of course. When asked about their near-term worries about the economy and financial markets, more than half cited the path of interest rates. Relations between the U.S. and China ranked as their second-biggest worry, and market overvaluation ranked third. The survey marked the first time since 2021 that inflation wasn't the top worry for the family offices surveyed, according to Citi. One of the big differences that sets family offices apart from other individual investors is their appetite for alternatives. Private equity, venture capital, real estate and hedge funds now account for 40% of the portfolios of the family offices surveyed. That number is likely to keep growing, especially as more family offices make direct investments in private companies. \"It's a significant allocation that shows family offices are asset allocators who are long-term investors, highly sophisticated and taking a long-term view,\" Hofmann said. One of the biggest themes for their private investments is artificial intelligence. The family offices of  Jeff Bezos  and  Bernard Arnault  have both made investments in AI startups, and repeated surveys show AI is the No. 1 investment theme for family offices this year. More than half of family offices surveyed by Citi have exposure to AI in their portfolios through public equities, private equity funds or direct private equity. Another 26% of family offices are considering adding to their AI investments. Hoffman said AI has already proven to be different from previous investment innovations such as crypto, and environmental, social and governance, or ESG. Only 17% of family offices are invested in digital assets, while a vast majority say they're not interested. \"AI is a theme that people are interested in and they're putting real money into it,\" Hofmann said. \"With crypto people were interested in it, but at best, they put some play money into it. With ESG, we're finding a lot of people are saying they're interested in it, but a much smaller percentage of family offices are actually really putting money into it.\""

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. The tightening presidential race has touched off a wave of tax planning by ultra-wealthy investors, especially given fears of a higher estate tax, according to advisors and tax attorneys. The scheduled \"sunset\" of a generous provision in the estate tax next year has taken on new urgency as the odds of a divided government or Democratic president have increased, tax experts say. Under current law, individuals can transfer up to $13.61 million (and couples can send up to $27.22 million) to family members or beneficiaries without owing estate or gift taxes. The benefit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 along with the other individual provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If it expires, the estate and gift tax exemption will fall by about half. Individuals will only be able to gift about $6 million to $7 million, and that rises to $12 million to $14 million for couples. Any assets transferred above those amounts will be subject to the 40% transfer tax. Wealth advisors and tax attorneys said expectations of a Republican sweep in the first half of the year led many wealthy Americans to take a wait-and-see approach, since former President  Donald Trump  wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts for individuals. Vice President  Kamala Harris  has advocated higher taxes for those those making more than $400,000. With Harris and Trump essentially tied in the polls, the odds have increased that the estate tax benefits will expire  either through gridlock or tax hikes. \"There is a little increased urgency now,\" said Pam Lucina, chief fiduciary officer for Northern Trust and head of its trust and advisory practice. \"Some people have been holding off until now.\" The sunset of the exemption, and the response by the wealthy, has broad ripple effects on inheritances and the trillions of dollars set to pass from older to younger generations in the coming years. More than  $84 trillion  is expected to be transferred to younger generations in the coming decades, and the estate tax \"cliff\" is set to accelerate many of those gifts this year and next. The biggest question facing wealthy families is how much to give, and when, in advance of any estate tax change. If they do nothing, and the estate exemption drops, they risk owing taxes on estates over $14 million if they die. On the other hand, if they give away the maximum now, and the estate tax provisions are extended, they may wind up with \"givers' remorse\"  which comes when donors gave away money unnecessarily due to fears of tax changes that never happened. \"With givers' remorse, we want to make sure clients look at the different scenarios,\" Lucina said. \"Will they need a lifestyle change? If it's an irrevocable gift, can they afford it?\" Advisors say clients should make sure their gift decisions are driven as much by family dynamics and personalities as they are by taxes. While giving the maximum of $27.22 million may make sense today from a tax perspective, it may not always make sense from a family perspective. \"The first thing we do is separate out those individuals who were going to make the gift anyway from those who have never done it and are only motivated to do it now because of the sunset,\" said MarkParthemer, chief wealth strategist and regional director of Floridafor Glenmede. \"While it may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity as it relates to the exemption, it's not the only thing. We want individuals to have peace of mind regardless of how it plays out.\" Parthemer said today's wealthy parents and grandparents need to make sure they are psychologically comfortable making large gifts. \"They're asking 'What if I live so long I outlive my money,'\" Parthemer said. \"We can do the math and figure out what makes sense. But there is also a psychological component to that. As people age, a lot of us become more concerned about our financial independence, regardless of whether the math tells us we're independent or not.\" The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  Some families may also fear their kids aren't ready for such large amounts. Wealthy families who planned to make big gifts years from now are feeling pressure from the tax change to go ahead with it now. \"Especially with families with younger children, a primary concern is having donors' remorse,\" said Ann Bjerke, head of the advanced planning group at UBS. Advisors say families can structure their gifts to be flexible  gifting to a spouse first, for instance, before it goes to the kids. Or setting up trusts that trickle out the money over time and reduce the changes of \"sudden wealth syndrome\" for kids. For families that plan to take advantage of the estate tax window, however, the time is now. It can take months to draft and file transfers. During a similar tax cliff in 2010, so many families rushed to process gifts and set up trusts that attorneys became overwhelmed and many clients were left stranded. Advisors say today's gifters face the same risk if they wait until after the election. \"We're already seeing some attorneys start to turn away new clients,\" Lucina said. Another risk with rushing is trouble with the IRS. Parthemer said the IRS recently unwound a strategy used by one couple, where the husband used his exemption to gift his kids money and gave his wife funds to regift using her own exemption. \"Both gifts were attributed to the wealthy spouse, triggering a gift tax,\" he said. \"You need to have time to measure twice and cut once, as they say.\" While advisors and tax attorneys said their wealthy clients are also calling them about other tax proposals in the campaign  from higher capital gains and corporate taxes to taxing unrealized gains  the estate tax sunset is far and away the most pressing and likely change. \"In the past month, inquiries have accelerated over the [estate exemption],\" Bjerke said. \"A lot of people were sitting on the sidelines waiting to implement their wealth-planning strategies. Now, more people are executing.\""

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Sales of ultra-luxury homes surged in New York, Miami and Palm Beach, Florida, in the second quarter, even as they fell in much of the rest of the world, according to a new report. The number of homes that sold for $10 million or more in the second quarter jumped 44% in Palm Beach, 27% in Miami and 16% in New York, according to a report from real estate firm Knight Frank. New York led the U.S. in $10 million-plus sales, with 72, its highest total in two years, according to the report. Miami came in second with 55, followed by Los Angeles with 42 and Palm Beach with 36. Los Angeles saw a 29% decline in $10 million-plus sales, due largely to the new \"mansion tax,\" which adds a 5.5% charge on homes sold for over $10 million, the report said. The biggest sale of the quarter was the $150 million deal in May for Palm Beach's only private island, reportedly purchased by Australian infrastructure investor Michael Dorrell, according to  The Wall Street Journal . In June, a historic 3.2-acre estate in Palm Beach sold for  $148 million , while in Manhattan, the penthouse of the Aman New York was sold for  $135 million  in July.

While demand in many top luxury markets is slowing from the 2021 peak, ultra-wealthy buyers continue to pay record prices for rare trophy properties, boosted in large part by rising financial markets, Knight Frank said. \"Substantial wealth creation has supported the growth in the global super-prime sales market,\" said Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank. \"The transformation of markets like Dubai, Palm Beach and Miami has more than offset the slowing experienced by some more mature markets.\" Globally, in the 11 top luxury markets that Knight Frank tracks, sales of $10 million-plus homes fell 4% over last year to $8.5 billion. Dubai leads the world in ultra-luxury real estate, with 85 sales in the second quarter, the report said. The city has seen a  stratospheric rise , as the ultra-rich from Russia, China, Europe and other areas moved to Dubai for its friendly tax and regulatory regimes. In 2019,  Dubai  had only 23 sales over $10 million. In the past 12 months, it has had 436 sales  although sales in the most recent quarter fell slightly from last year and the first quarter, Knight Frank said. London saw one of the largest declines in the world, with sales of $10 million-plus homes plunging 47% from last year on fears of higher taxes on the U.K. wealthy, according to Knight Frank. Although ultra-luxury buyers usually pay cash for their properties, falling interest rates throughout the world are expected to help support sales in the second half, according to the report. Last week, 29 contracts were signed in Manhattan for properties priced over $4 million, according to the  Olshan Luxury Market report   the strongest post-Labor Day week since at least 2006. \"With rates moving lower, total transaction volumes are likely to tick higher into 2025,\" Bailey said."

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. On Sept. 29, 1916, newspapers across the country announced a wealth milestone once thought to be unreachable: the world's first billionaire. \"Standard (Oil) at $2,014 makes its head a billionaire,\" blared The New York Times headline, adding that Standard Oil's soaring share price \"makes John D. Rockefeller, founder and largest shareholder, almost certainly a billionaire.\" More than a century after the first U.S. billionaire (in measurable dollar terms), the question of who will be first to reach the trillionaire mark continues to fascinate. At least a half-dozen companies have done it, most recently  Berkshire Hathaway , which  topped $1 trillion  just before  Warren Buffett 's  94th birthday .  Nvidia  is now at $2.6 trillion, having hit the 13-figure club last year. And what about individuals? According to a new report from  Informa Connect Academy , which predicts trillionaire status based on average annual growth rate in wealth,  Tesla  CEO  Elon Musk  will likely be the first trillionaire. Musk is currently the world's richest person, with $251 billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Connect Academy forecasts Musk will become a trillionaire sometime in 2027, assuming that his wealth continues to grow at an annual average rate of 110%. The second to reach trillionaire status, according to the report, will be India's Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani Group conglomerate. If Adani maintains his recent annual growth rate of 123%, the report says he will be a trillionaire in 2028. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, who has seen his  wealth skyrocket  from $3 billion to more than $90 billion in five years, would become a trillionaire by 2028, according to the report. His wealth would have to continue growing at an average annual rate of 112%. Nvidia's stock is already up about 115% this year, after more than tripling last year.

Fourth on the list is Indonesia's Prajogo Pangestu, founder of the Indonesian energy and mining conglomerate Barito Pacific. The report predicts Pangestu could reach trillionaire status by 2028. Rounding out the top five would be  LVMH  CEO Bernard Arnault, who is currently the world's third-richest person, with just under $200 billion. The report has the luxury king becoming a trillionaire sometime in 2030, along with  Meta  CEO  Mark Zuckerberg . Some top billionaires who seem like strong candidates to quickly reach the four-comma club don't make the top 10. Jeff Bezos, currently the world's second-richest person, with $200 billion, according to Bloomberg, is listed at No. 12, and wouldn't become a trillionaire until 2036. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the  Google  founders, are also slated to wait 12 years to become trillionaires  although artificial intelligence may accelerate their rise. Granted, wealth-watchers have been predicting the first trillionaire for years. And the stocks of Tesla, Nvidia and LVMH may not go up as fast in the next five years as they did in the past five. Yet more than 100 years after the first billionaire, the first trillionaire could well be crowned in the next decade."

        "header": "Family offices are about to surpass hedge funds, with $5.4 trillion in assets by 2030",
        "content": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Family offices are expected to add more than $2 trillion in assets by 2030, as an increase in wealth concentration and a revolution in wealth management drive rapid growth in new family offices. The number of single-family offices  the in-house investment and service firms of families typically worth $100 million or more  is expected to rise from 8,000 to 10,720 by 2030, according to a report from  Deloitte Private . Their assets are expected to grow even faster, topping $5.4 trillion by 2030, up from $3.1 trillion today and more than doubling since 2019. In total, the wealth of families with family offices is expected to top $9.5 trillion in 2030, according to the report  more than doubling over the decade. \"The growth has been explosive,\" said Rebecca Gooch, global head of insights for Deloitte Private. \"It's really the past decade that has seen an acceleration in growth in family offices.\" The rise of family offices is remaking the wealth management industry and creating a powerful new force in the financial landscape. Projected to have more assets than hedge funds in the coming years, family offices have become the new stars of fundraising, with venture capital firms, private equity interests and private companies all competing to capture a slice of their rising wealth. The growth is being driven by two broader economic forces. Increasingly, wealth is growing fastest at the top of the pyramid, as technology and globalization create winner-take-all markets and outsized rewards for tech entrepreneurs. The number of Americans worth $30 million or more grew 7.5% in 2023, to 90,700, while their fortunes surged to $7.4 trillion, according to CapGemini. The population of centimillionaires  those worth $100 million or more  has more than doubled over the past 20 years to over 28,000, according to Henley & Partners and New World Wealth. There are now an estimated 2,700 billionaires in the world, according to Forbes, more than 2.5 times the number in 2010. At the same time, the ultra-wealthy are changing the way they manage their investments and financial lives. Rather than handing over their fortunes to a single private bank or wealth management firm, today's mega-wealthy are opting to create single-family offices to better represent their interests and long-term goals. Family offices are seen as offering more privacy, more customization and more tailored programs for the next generation of the family. \"They want a team that's entirely dedicated to them, 24 hours a day,\" Gooch said. \"Not only with investing, but in all the different areas of their life.\" After the financial crisis, wealthy families also want advisors that represent the family's best interests, rather than private bank or wealth management advisors incentivized by the need to sell product. \"There are some organizations that don't have products to pitch, but a lot of them do,\" said Eric Johnson, Deloitte's private wealth leader and family office tax leader. \"And, lo and behold, if you engage them, what you're going to have to buy is kind of what they're selling, which might not be the best for the family.\" More than two-thirds of family offices have been created since 2000, according to Deloitte. The largest number (41%) were founded by the original wealth creators, while 30% serve the second generation (inheritors) and 19% serve the third generation. North America is leading the family office revolution. Family office wealth in North America is expected to grow by 258% between 2019 and 2030, compared with 208% in the Asia-Pacific region. North America's 3,180 single-family offices are expected to balloon to 4,190 by 2030, accounting for about 40% of the world's total. Asia-Pacific has about 2,290 family offices today, expected to grow to 3,200 by 2030. The total wealth held by families with family offices in North America has more than doubled since 2019, to $2.4 trillion. It's expected to reach $4 trillion by 2030, according to Deloitte.

That $5 trillion pool of capital globally has touched off a feeding frenzy on Wall Street to help family offices manage their money. From Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to UBS, J.P. Morgan Private Bank, Citi Private Bank, and myriad trust companies and multifamily offices, traditional wealth-management firms are poaching family office specialists and launching new family office teams to better target the growth. Accounting firms, tax attorneys, consulting firms and tech companies are also waking up to the  power of family offices , which can now more easily outsource parts of their business to keep costs lower. \"There is a whole new arena of companies that benefit from this ecosystem,\" Gooch said. As they expand in both size and number, family offices are also becoming more institutionalized. Rather than two- or three-person shops focused on basic portfolios and arranging family travel, today's family offices are more like  boutique investment firms . The average family office has a staff of 15 people managing $2 billion, according to Deloitte. Family offices are also changing how they invest. Instead of the old-school 60-40 stock and bond portfolios, family offices are shifting their money to  alternative assets , including private equity, venture capital, real estate and private credit. Family offices now have 46% of their total portfolio in alternative investments, according to the J.P. Morgan Private Bank Global Family Office Report. The largest amount is in private equity, at 19%. Aside from investing in private equity funds, more family offices are doing direct deals, where they  invest directly in a private company . A survey by BNY Wealth found that 62% of family offices made at least six direct investments last year, and 71% plan to make the same number of direct deals this year. Private equity giants like Blackstone, KKR and Carlyle are building out their private wealth teams to better target family offices. Deal-makers for private companies are also discovering family offices, which can buy equity stakes or entire companies. Since family offices have long time horizons, preferring to invest for decades or even generations, they're seen as more \"patient capital\" compared with private equity firms or venture capital. \"Family offices can be very solid, strong partners to invest with,\" Gooch said. \"I think a lot of the private companies are very grateful for their long-term patient capital and their dedication to this space.\" To support their growing assets and responsibilities, family offices are on a hiring spree. Fully 40% of family offices plan to hire more staff this year, according to Deloitte. More than a third (36%) say they plan to increase the number of services they provide to the family, or increase the number of family members served. More than a third (34%) are also increasing their reliance on outsourcing, Deloitte notes. Deloitte said the biggest trends for family offices in the coming years will be the continued move toward \"institutionalization\"  with more professional management, governance and technology. More than a quarter of family offices now have multiple \"branches\" to serve different parts of the family, often in other countries. And with the  great wealth transfer  expected to shift trillions of dollars to spouses and the next generation, more women and inheritors will start running family offices in the coming years. The average age of family office principals in the Deloitte survey was 68 years old, and 4 in 10 family offices will go through a succession process in the next decade. While women represent 10% of the wealth holders for those with $100 million or more, they control 15% of the world's family offices, according to the survey. \"On a like-for-like basis with men, women are somewhat more likely to become the principal of the family office,\" Gooch said. \"Family offices can really focus on key stages of life, like retirement or legacy planning. And making sure the next generation is prepared.\""

        "header": "Burberry\u2019s FTSE relegation confirms a long fall from grace for the luxury fashion icon",
        "content": "LONDON  British luxury fashion house  Burberry Group  dropped out of the U.K.s  FTSE 100  stock market index on Wednesday, as waning sales and a slew of management changes have added to the mounting pressures facing the 168-year-old retailer. The company slipped into the FTSE 250 during Septembers quarterly rebalancing, index provider FTSE Russell said in a  statement , bringing its 15-year run in the U.K. large-cap FTSE 100 blue-chip index to a close. The changes will be implemented at the close of trade on Sept. 20 and will take effect from Sept. 23. The relegation deals a fresh blow to Burberry, whose share price has suffered a precipitous decline over recent months as the brand has fallen out of favor with consumers amid a wider slowdown in the luxury market. The stock is down more than 53% so far this year and around 70% lower over the last 12 months. The companys current market cap of 2.34 billion ($3.06 billion) now puts it well below the other  constituents of the FTSE 100 , as well as some of the  top performers in the FTSE 250.  As such, funds that invest in the FTSE 100 will exit their Burberry holdings. Burberrys struggles long predate the recent share price declines. Founded in Basingstoke, England, in 1856 and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002, Burberry rose to international recognition with its signature collection of trench coats, handbags and its eponymous check print. The luxury labels addition to the FTSE 100 in September 2009 was taken as a further mark of its enduring appeal and its resilience, even amid the global financial crisis. However, the gradual adoption of Burberrys iconic pattern by the British working class through the 1990s and 2000s dealt a heavy blow to the brands high-end aesthetic  one from which it has struggled to recover. Successive CEOs have attempted to revive the companys image and elevate it to an upmarket brand, but the market has not been convinced. High turnover at the top leadership levels  with four CEOs taking the post in the last decade  has also left investors jittery. The appointment of Joshua Schulman as CEO in July now suggests a change in direction. Luca Solca, managing director and sector head of global luxury goods at Bernstein, said that the former Coach and Michael Kors CEO could attempt to revive the companys fortunes by shifting the focus from brand elevation to a British Coach strategy. That would include reducing costs, doubling down on outlets and increasing exposure to off-price retailers. We have advocated a British Coach strategy. The appointment of Josh Schulman, a former CEO of MK and Coach, seems to go in this very direction, Solca told CNBC by email. According to Bernstein estimates, the fresh approach could provide a much-needed boost to the companys struggling financials. Burberry reported a  21% fall  in first-quarter comparable store sales in July, prompting it to issue its third profit warning in 12 months and suspend its dividend payments Analysts are now warning that further share price declines could be expected in the absence of a significant reset. Current trading trends point to soft brand momentum for the Burberry brand which in our view needs to be addressed soon enough for Burberry to contain any further market share losses, RBC analysts Piral Dadhania and Richard Chamberlain wrote in a July note. That, according to Solca, could make the company a takeover target. If, however, the leadership changes work and the share price revives, he said, the probability of a takeover decreases. Schulman is due to give an update on his strategy in November, and further change could be expected at the top before that time. The fashion brand is now reportedly working with headhunters to replace its chairman, Gerry Murphy,  according to Sky News . Burberry did not immediately respond to CNBCs request for comment on the report. Cole Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management, suggested that Schulman could assume the chairmanship, too, to allow him to proceed quickly with his strategy and restore investor confidence. Such a practice is uncommon in U.K. firms, but relatively normal in the U.S. Its a waste of time for the board to go out and search for the right chairman, when there are real needs to focus on with Mr. Schulman in his endeavor for shareholders, Smead, who is an investor in Burberry, said by email. In a separate note, he suggested that the entire board be overhauled to reassure investors. Burberry is not alone in its waning fortunes. The luxury sector as a whole has suffered from a prolonged downturn in consumer spending amid inflationary pressures and broader economic uncertainty. Chinese luxury consumption has been especially hard hit. In July,  Hugo Boss  cut its full-year guidance after reporting a  fall in sales , notably in the U.K. and China, while Gucci owner  Kering  issued a  weak forecast , as a marked deceleration in China weighed on first-half revenue.  LVMH  revenue also fell in the second quarter on  weaker sales  in Asia, excluding Japan. Certain players, primarily those in the ultraluxe space, have managed to weather the storm. Cartier owner Richemont reported  record full-year sales  in May, while Hermes sale were up 13% in the  second quarter. Smead said that the slowdown demonstrated the cyclical nature of the luxury sector  an often overlooked factor  but also showed the ongoing opportunities for Burberry to recover. The old saying is if youre going to get behind, get behind early. Burberry got behind early and we believe they will deal with their real problems sooner than the other luxury players, he said. Smead added that he expects the company will ultimately return to the FTSE 100, but that fresh leadership was unlikely to reinstate its large dividend given lack of foresight over earlier payments. Burberrys half-year financial results are due out on Nov. 14."

        "content": "LONDON  Monaco, Italy, Switzerland, Dubai. They're just a few of the destinations trying to lure away the U.K.'s uber wealthy ahead of proposed changes to the country's divisive non-dom tax regime. Almost two-thirds (63%) of wealthy investors said they plan to leave the U.K. within two years or \"shortly\" if the Labour government moves ahead with plans to ax the colonial-era tax concession, while 67% said they would not have emigrated to Britain in the first place, according to a  new study  from Oxford Economics, which assesses the implications of the plans. The U.K.'s non-dom regime is a 200-year-old tax rule, which permits people living in the U.K. but who are domiciled elsewhere to avoid paying tax on income and capital gains earnings overseas for up to 15 years. As of 2023, an estimated  74,000 people  enjoyed the status, up from 68,900 the previous year. Labour last month set out  plans  to abolish the status, expanding on a pledge set out in its election  manifesto  and stepping up earlier proposals by the previous Conservative government to  phase out  the regime over time. It comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to improve fairness and shore up the public finances, with further announcements expected early next week at the Labour Party's annual conference and during the Oct. 30 Autumn budget statement. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves has said that scrapping the program could generate  2.6 billion  ($3.45 billion) over the course of the next government. However, Oxford Economics' research, which was produced earlier this month in collaboration with lobby group Foreign Investors for Britain, estimates the changes will instead cost taxpayers 1 billion by 2029/30. CNBC reached out to the Treasury for comment and did not immediately receive a response. \"We are ringing out the alarm bell that this is a perilous time,\" Macleod-Miller, CEO of Foreign Investors for Britain, told CNBC over the phone. \"If the government doesn't listen they'll put at risk revenues for generations.\" Under the proposals, the concept of \"domicile\" will be eliminated and replaced with a resident-based system, while the number of years in which money earned abroad goes untaxed in the U.K. will be cut from 15 to four. Individuals will also have to pay inheritance tax after 10 years of U.K. residency and would remain liable for 10 years after leaving the country. They will also be prevented from avoiding inheritance tax on assets held in trust. However, Macleod-Miller, a private wealth practitioner who launched the lobby group in response to the proposals, said the changes would stymy wealth generation and is instead calling for a tiered tax regime. According to the Oxford Economics research, which surveyed 72 non-doms and 42 tax advisors representing a further 952 non-dom clients, virtually all (98%) said they would emigrate from the U.K. sooner than previously planned if the reforms were implemented. The 72 non-doms surveyed were said to have invested 118 million each into the U.K. economy. The majority (83%) cited inheritance tax on their worldwide assets as their key motivator for leaving, while 65% also referenced changes to income and capital gains tax. It comes as other countries are shaking up their tax regimes to incentivize wealthy investors. Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Greece, Malta, Dubai and the Caribbean island of the Bahamas are among the various destinations proving most attractive to wealthy investors, according to industry experts and agents CNBC spoke to. \"Wealthy investors have a lot of choices now and a lot of domiciles are fighting for them,\" Helena Moyas de Forton, managing director and head of EMEA and APAC at Christie's International Real Estate, told CNBC. Moyas de Forton, whose team advises clients on international relocation, said Labour's plans were the latest in a string of political developments which have shaken the U.K.'s reputation as a safe haven over recent years. \"It's just another hit,\" she said. \"I'm not sure if they're all leaving but definitely they're questioning and taking their time to see what's changing.\" A  record number of millionaires  are expected to leave the U.K. this year, according to a June report from migration consultancy Henley & Partners, which cited the July general election as adding to a period of post-Brexit political flux. It is estimated that Britain will record a net loss of 9,500 high-net-worth individuals in 2024, more than double last year's 4,200. \"It is definitely a danger. The markets are so fungible nowadays. It's easy for people to move home. It's easy for people to move their businesses,\" Marcus Meijer, CEO of real estate investor Mark, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" of the non-dom changes last week. Among the alternative offerings available to the ultra wealthy are indefinite inheritance tax exemptions in Monaco, Malta and Gibraltar, and an absence of income, capital gains and inheritance tax in Dubai. In Italy and Greece, flat tax regimes allow the wealthy to avoid paying tax on their worldwide assets for an annual fee of 100,000 euros for up to 15 years. Italy last month  doubled  its fee for new arrivals to 200,000 euros ($223,283) in a move its economy minister said was designed to avoid \"fiscal favors\" for the wealthy. However, Macleod-Miller said the regime would likely remain appealing to the top 1% even at a slightly higher rate. \"Other countries are smelling the fear and actively promoting their jurisdictions and attracting their investment and their families,\" Macleod-Miller said. \"Italy is one of those countries which is courting the wealthy and seems to think if you treat them well they will contribute,\" he added. That is also impacting the U.K.'s prime real estate market. James Myers, director at London-based luxury real estate agency Oliver James, saw an uptick in sales activity in anticipation of Labour's election in July. But now, around 30% to 40% of clients are lowering asking prices to generate a quicker sale. \"A lot of people are worried. They would rather get out now before it's too late,\" Myers told CNBC over the phone. Many of Myers' multimillionaire and multibillionaire clients have already started to put down roots in Monaco and Dubai, with Italy \"becoming a thing\" more recently, too, he said. Transactions in London's super-prime residential market, which covers homes valued at 10 million and above, fell 22% in the year to July compared to the previous 12 months, according to whole market data published Wednesday by property agency Knight Frank. The decline was most pronounced in properties valued above 30 million, with just 10 sales generated compared to 38 the previous year, which the report attributed to higher buyer discretion. Stuart Bailey, Knight Frank's head of super-prime sales for London, noted that Autumn Statement uncertainty had now replaced election uncertainty, with non-doms not the only group being spooked by Labour's anticipated tax changes. Ultra-wealthy U.K. citizens, who are typically highly active in the super-prime market, are also in \"wait and see\" mode ahead of possible changes to capital gains and inheritance tax. It follows previously announced VAT (tax levy) charges for private schools. \"Non doms are a sector of that super-prime market, but they're not the be all and end all,\" Bailey said over the phone. That is, however, creating opportunities for other investors, Bailey noted. U.S. citizens, who are already subject to U.S. tax on their worldwide assets, and so-called 90 dayers, whose annual stay in the U.K. falls below the tax threshold, could ultimately benefit from reduced competition. \"U.S. buyers, especially those sitting on a lot of cash, would be crazy not to think it's a good time to buy right now,\" he said."

        "header": "Soaring sports team values create new pressure for owners on taxes, succession ",
        "content": "Sports team owners benefiting from soaring team values are also facing new pressure from two of the oldest certainties in American wealth: death and taxes. With the average age of team owners rising, and team values skyrocketing into the billions, owners and leagues are increasingly focused on how to ensure smooth ownership transitions to the next generation of buyers. While today's owners have highly sophisticated tax and succession plans, even the best plans can blow up over family disputes or unexpected tax changes. \"The people who bought sports teams a long time ago have now found that a large portion, if not a vast majority, of their long-term estate is now the value of the team,\" said Stephen Amdur, co-leader of mergers and acquisitions and private equity practices at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, who advises many billionaire team owners. \"They're thinking a lot about who is going to hold it for the next generation and what they're going to do with it.\" Succession and taxes have become especially important in the National Football League, where the average age of team owners is now over 72 and team values are all surging. The average NFL team is now worth $6.49 billion, and no team is valued at less than $5.25 billion, according to CNBC's Official 2024 NFL Team Valuations.  The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  NFL owners face one of two painful choices: They can sell the team while they're alive, which can create massive capital gains tax bills, or they can pass the team to their families, which can trigger estate taxes or prolonged family battles for control. Former Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen created a detailed succession and tax plan for the team a decade before his death in 2019. Yet a bitter dispute among family members, both before and after he died, led the team to be sold in 2022 to  Walmart  heir Rob Walton for $4.65 billion. Tennessee Titans founder Bud Adams, who died in October 2013, had divided ownership of the team among three branches of his family, which he thought would keep the peace. Instead, the split created a highly public battle over control, leading to an eventual deal within the family. Amy Adams Strunk, Bud's daughter, is now controlling owner of the team. Longtime New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson touched off years of litigation when he removed his daughter and two grandchildren from his estate and passed ownership of the NFL team and the National Basketball Association's New Orleans Pelicans to his wife Gayle when he died in 2018. She still maintains control of the Saints. And perhaps the most poignant cautionary tale in the NFL is the legendary Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, who left the team to his wife and nine children at the time of his death in 1990. A family feud and estate taxes of more than $45 million forced the family to sell a majority of the team in 1994. Under current U.S. tax law, estates over $13.6 million for individuals or $27.2 million for couples are subject to a tax of 40%. Since teams in the NFL and NBA are now worth billions, all team owners could potentially be subject to hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes without proper planning. Another wrinkle: It's unclear whether the estate tax rates would change in 2025, when the current levels are set to expire. So owners have to be planning for the potential for more punitive estate taxes in the coming years. Trust and estate attorneys say today's team owners have a much broader array of tools at their disposal to minimize the tax impact of succession. One of the most popular is the family limited partnership, which makes family members minority stakeholders and leaves the primary owner, as the general partner, with control. By dividing up ownership, the partnership can lower the value of assets (and therefore of the taxable estate) of the general partner. Owners can also split ownership among family members through individual trusts, as Chicago Bears owner George \"Papa Bear\" Halas Sr. did with his 13 grandchildren. They can also transfer an interest in the team into an irrevocable trust through a partnership or an LLC. \"Owners are spending more time on the front end thinking about long-term estate planning to ensure as tax-efficient an outcome as possible,\" Amdur said. That's assuming the team stays in the family, of course. While owners often hope to pass their passion and financial commitment to a team on to their children, the  next generations often have different interests or financial goals , which could mean offloading some team ownership. And there's now a fresh pool of prospective buyers. The NFL last week  voted to allow select private equity firms to buy minority stakes  in teams, giving owners and their families a chance to draw down cash that they could then reinvest in their teams or invest in nonsports assets to better diversify  all while keeping control. \"I think it's an appropriate thing to give the teams that liquidity to reinvest in the game and to their teams,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in making the announcement.

Of the six new crypto billionaires created over the past year, five can attribute their newfound wealth to bitcoin, \"underscoring its dominant position when it comes to attracting long-term investors who buy large holdings,\" according to Andrew Amoils, head of research for New World Wealth. According to Forbes , the richest crypto billionaire (for the third year in a row) is Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of crypto exchange Binance, who's worth an estimated $33 billion. Zhao  pled guilty to U.S. money laundering charges  in November and agreed to pay a $50 million fine. His wealth has soared by more than $10.5 billion over the past year. Ranking second is Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of  Coinbase,  worth an estimated $11 billion, according to Forbes. He's followed by Giancarlo Devasini, the chief financial officer of Tether; and Michael Saylor, the cofounder of MicroStrategy,  according to the list . Granted, many crypto assets are still below their 2021 highs, and bitcoin's recent rise essentially marks a three-year round-trip to those levels. Crypto assets reached a market cap of $3 trillion in November of 2021. Yet the growing acceptance of crypto assets among big asset managers like  BlackRock  and  Fidelity,  with help from  Morgan Stanley's   salesforce of 15,000 brokers,  could fuel further wealth creation among large crypto holders. Crypto will not only create more millionaires and billionaires, but it will also change where the rich live and work. According to Henley, many of the newly crypto rich are looking to move to tax-friendly and crypto-friendly jurisdictions. \"We've seen a significant uptick in crypto-wealthy clients seeking alternative residence and citizenship options,\" said Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley & Partners. To better advise the new crypto nomads, Henley created a \"Crypto Adoption Index,\" ranking countries according to their tax and regulatory approach to crypto. Singapore ranks first on the index, due to its \"supportive banking system, significant investment, comprehensive regulations such as the Payment Services Act, regulatory sandboxes, and alignment with global standards,\" according to Henley. Hong Kong ranked second, followed by the United Arab Emirates and the United States. In the U.S., according to the report, 15% of the population owns cryptocurrencies: \"This is supported by strong infrastructure, with a high density of crypto ATMs, crypto-friendly banks, and an increasing number of businesses accepting cryptocurrency,\" the report said. Correction: This story has been updated to correct a headline that misstated the number of crypto millionaires created by the bitcoin rally."

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Auction sales during Monterey Car Week fell 3% from last year, as a shift from older to newer cars left a pileup of unsold classics from the 1950s and 1960s. Total sales at this year's five car auctioneers in Monterey  RM Sotheby's, Broad Arrow, Gooding & Company, Mecum and Bonhams  fell to $391.6 million this year from $403 million in 2023, according to Hagerty, the classic-car insurance company. That followed a decline of 14% last year compared with the peak of 2022. Of the 1,143 cars up for sale, only 821 sold  marking a 72% sell-through rate, according to Hagerty. The average sale price was $476,965, down slightly from last year's average of $477,866. Experts say wealthy collectors still have plenty of money to spend and are feeling confident given the recent rise in the stock market, but the types of cars they want are changing. There were simply too many similar cars at too many auctions to generate strong prices and sales. \"It's saturation,\" said Simon Kidston, the founder of Kidston and a leading advisor to wealthy car collectors. \"When I walked around the auctions and saw so much similar 'product,' I asked myself if any of them had thought about what they or their rivals already had consigned, and if the cars were vying for the same buyers. Add to that the fact that many entries had already been in dealer windows for months or years which always feels like sloppy seconds.\" At the same time, a new generation of collectors driving the market  mainly Gen Xers and millennials  prefer cars from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The 1950s and 1960s classic cars that powered the market for decades and are popular with baby boomers are pouring onto the market and failing to find buyers. The sell-through rate in Monterey (or the percentage of cars that actually sold on the auction block) was an anemic 52% for pre-1981 cars priced at $1 million or more, according to Hagerty. The sell-through rate for cars less than 4 years old was a much stronger 73%  proving that young collectors are now in the drivers seat. Hagertys Supercar Index of sports cars from the 1980s through the 2000s is up over 60% from 2019, while the Blue Chip Index of 1950s and 1960s Corvettes, Ferraris, Jaguars and other storied classics is down 3%. Granted, a small number of rare, true masterpieces will still fetch high prices. The top car of the week was a 1960 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider that sold at RM Sothebys for $17 million and the runner-up was a 1938 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Lungo Spider thats one of only five in existence. Yet the broader changing of the guard in classic cars, especially as many older collectors start selling off or downsizing their collections, is likely to weigh on prices for older cars for years.

At the lower end of the market, many buyers had been using financing to buy cars and build their collections. At the high end, rising rates raised the opportunity cost of buying a classic car. People think, Instead of that million-dollar car, I could be earning 5% maybe 10% if you've got a great manager, Kidston said. That, more than anything else, makes people think twice. A collector car is partially investment. Theres no other single reason for the increase in the value of collector cars over the last 40 years than the investment angle.

        "content": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Luxury king Bernard Arnault is shopping for AI companies. Arnault, founder and CEO of  LVMH  and the world's fourth-richest person with a net worth of $184 billion, has made a string of artificial intelligence investments this year through his tech-focused venture firm and family office, called Agla Ventures. Agla made five AI-related investments in 2024, according to data provided exclusively to CNBC by Fintrx, the private wealth intelligence platform. While the amounts of Agla's investments aren't disclosed, the funding rounds for the AI firms totaled more than $300 million, according to Fintrx. The largest funding round this year, according to Fintrx, was in a firm called H, formerly known as Holistic AI, a French startup that's working toward full artificial general intelligence. It was founded by former members of  Google's  DeepMind AI unit and includes venture firm Accel Partners LP and Wendy and Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, as investors. The $220 million round in May, which also included Agla, valued H at $370 million, according to the company. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  Agla also invested in a $25 million seed round for Lamini, a Palo Alto, California-based startup building enterprise AI applications. In April, Agla was part of a $12 million series A round for Proxima, a New York-based AI-powered digital marketing company. Agla joined Susquehanna to invest in the $27 million seed round for Toronto-based Borderless AI, a human resource management platform. And, it invested in Photoroom, a France-based AI image editor, as part of a $43 million investment round in February. While many of Agla's AI investments are recent, it invested in four funding rounds between 2017 and 2019 in Paris-based Meero, an AI-powered photo creation company, according to Fintrx. The family office's other investments this year were in Sonarverse, an Irvine, California-based blockchain company, and Shimmer, a San Francisco-based provider of ADHD coaching. Since 2017, Agla has made a total of 153 investments, according to Fintrx data, with 53 in technology, 17 in consumer goods, 13 in business services and 12 in financial services. Its other investments include Noom, a digital health platform, and World Music Media, a music creation app. Agla was part of multiple rounds of funding for Back Market, a French-based marketplace for refurbished electronics products that in 2022 reported a valuation of $5.7 billion. Since the Arnault family fortune is so heavily concentrated in LVMH, with the family owning about 48% of the shares and controlling 64% of the voting rights, Agla has little reason to invest in luxury. Arnault and his family are, however, big art collectors, and Agla was an investor in a $9.5 million funding round for LaCollection, a digital art platform. LVMH has expanded rapidly in the luxury watch segment and Agla was an investor in the $108 million funding round in 2021 for watch trading platform Chrono24. While famous for his dedication to luxury craftsmanship, historic brands, and emotional connections to designs and artists, Arnault is also a big technology fan with a history of backing successful tech startups. His family office was an early investor in  Netflix  in 1999,  Spotify  in 2014 and  Airbnb  in 2015. In a speech in May at the LVMH Innovation Awards, Arnault said he invested in 75 startups in the 1990s, and \"some of them made it, but many didn't.\" \"The startup mentality is very close to our values: creativity, quality  it has to work  an entrepreneurial spirit and meaning,\" he said."

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Wealthy investors and family offices shied away from stocks leading up to market swings this week, but many saw the drop in prices as an opportunity for tax savings and estate planning, according to wealth advisors. Private banks and wealth managers say their clients have been reducing their stock holdings for over a year as part of a broader shift from public to private markets in light of recent concerns about an overheated tech sector. According to a UBS family office survey, family offices have 35% of their portfolios in private equity  the largest of any asset class  compared with just 28% in equities. A Deloitte survey found that family office holdings of equities fell from 34% to 25% from 2021 to 2023, while their private equity jumped from 22% in 2021 to 30% in 2023. When stocks tumbled Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down 3%, wealthy investors neither panicked nor jumped in to buy, according to several advisors. They did have a lot of questions. \"The common question from clients was 'What's going on?'\" said Sean Apgar, partner and co-head of portfolio and wealth advisory at BBR Partners, which advises ultra-wealthy clients. \"It was more out of curiosity; there was no real motive for action.\" Apgar said the clients BBR advises  most worth hundreds of millions or billions  don't react to short-term market events given their long investing horizons. Yet they did want to be educated about the market moves, the Japanese carry trade, the growing recession fears and rate cut odds. For his clients, their investment plan is still their investment plan.  \"The best thing clients can do right now is sit back and feel good about the investment plan we put in place with them long ago, with expected volatility and corrections along the way,\" Apgar said. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  The drop in prices last Friday and Monday also offered a chance for wealthy investors to take advantage of tax benefits and gift strategies. William Sinclair, head of the financial institutions group and the U.S. family office practice at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, said a growing number of clients have so-called \"separately managed accounts,\" discreet accounts designed to hold a specific group of assets or stocks. With separate accounts, clients can more easily sell stocks that have declined in value and realize losses they can use to offset capital gains from their winning stocks, known as \"tax-loss harvesting.\" With some Big Tech stocks down 15% or more over the past month, wealthy investors are selling at a loss, reaping the tax benefits and buying the stock back at a later date to retain their position. \"For taxable clients, the biggest inflows have been in tax loss harvesting strategies,\" Sinclair said. Others are using the price swings for estate planning. Under the current rules of the estate and gift tax, married couples can transfer up to $27.22 million to heirs and family members, while individuals can transfer up to $13.61 million. With the gift and estate exemption amount scheduled to expire at the end of next year, many wealthy investors are working to give away the maximum before the expiration. Gifting stocks that have declined in value carries more benefits, since it allows investors to gift more stock under the exemption amount. \"Say you have a stock that was worth $100 and now it's worth $80, you can transfer that lower value to the next generation, assuming the assets will eventually appreciate again,\" Apgar said. \"So you're taking advantage of the depressed values. Tax advisors get generally excited about these environments because it opens up new opportunities.\" One group of clients that's more sensitive to the recent bouts of volatility is made up of corporate founders and top executives. Since they often have a large portion of their wealth tied up in one company stock, advisors can help them structure complex hedges  such as variable prepaid forwards and exchange funds  to help dampen the blow of big stock declines. The stock decline of the past week highlighted the benefits of so-called \"collaring\" structures to many founders and CEOs.  \"People in these roles, in the C-suite, know that their job, as well as career, is going to center on the stock,\" said Jennifer Povlitz, division director at UBS Wealth Management U.S., which advises many clients with concentrated stock positions. \"So the financial planning part has to be a consideration.\" While the S&P 500 is still up roughly 10% this year, after gaining 24% in 2023, ultra-wealthy investors and family offices are continuing to shift more of their money into alternatives, especially private equity. Many see private companies as more stable and profitable over the long term compared to equities  especially after days like Monday. And they can have more impact on management with direct stakes in private companies.  \"Most family offices are so invested in alternatives, hedge funds, PE and real estate, that they aren't moving their investments around anyway,\" said Geoffrey von Kuhn, an advisor to several of the nation's largest family offices. Richard Weintraub, family office group head of the Americas at Citi Private Bank, said family offices have been moving their money to longer-term investments  which can grow over decades or generations  with less volatility. Along with private equity and venture, the big trend among family offices is direct deals to buy stakes or control of private companies. \"The larger family offices, so $10 billion plus, are deploying capital into operating companies they can hold in perpetuity and pass down generation to generation,\" Weintraub said. \"Like building the Buffett model.\" He added that the stock swoons of the past week \"reinforced the idea of making that shift toward private investments.\" Michael Pelzar, head of investments at Bank of America Private Bank, said high-net-worth investors are still catching up to family offices when it comes to private markets and alternatives. \"In general, I think high-net-worth investors are under-allocated to alternatives,\" Pelzar said. \"We see this [volatility] as a catalyst to enable high-net-worth investors to continue to broaden their portfolio. I think that after this week there will be more open-mindedness when it comes to alternatives, whether in PE or real estate.\" Advisors say that when it comes to the overall investing environment, the biggest worries of high-net-worth investors are about geopolitical risks and fiscal spending. Jimmy Chang, CIO forRockefellerGlobal Family Office,said the most common question clients are asking is not about stock market volatility but about the impact of government debt and deficits. \"They want to know the implications for tax planning and also for the economy and the market,\" he said."

        "header": "Murdoch family battle highlights Nevada\u2019s secret trust boom",
        "content": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBCs Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. The Murdoch family feud taking place in an obscure Nevada court highlights the states surging popularity as a global center of family trusts and a friendly home to the worlds biggest fortunes. According to legal industry rankings, Nevada is now the top state in the country when it comes to so-called asset-protection trusts like the one at the center of the Murdoch dispute. The states unique combination of no income taxes, iron-clad secrecy protections and strong defenses against creditors makes it the ideal location for big family trusts created to protect assets. Nevada doesnt report the total amount of assets in its trusts. The Western states fast-growing industry of trust and estate attorneys, trust companies and facilitators keeps a deliberately low profile. Yet experts estimate the state likely has hundreds of billions of dollars in trust assets locked away in nondescript office buildings or trust companies, offering little to no visibility to the outside world. Nevada is No. 1 and has been for at least four years, said Steven Oshins, a Nevada attorney who publishes the most widely cited ranking of states based on their appeal to asset-protection trusts. South Dakota is a close second, and then there is a big drop-off for the next batch with Tennessee, Delaware and others, Oshins added. Nevadas advantage puts it at the forefront of a massive wealth surge pouring into the asset-protection trusts. The U.S. hosted more than $5.6 trillion in trust and estate assets as of 2021  more than double the level of 2011, according to data from economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. The estimate is just the top of a multitrillion-dollar iceberg, according to the group, since many trusts are not reported to the IRS. Much of the recent growth is being driven by the so-called Great Wealth Transfer, in which over $80 trillion is expected to be passed down to the next generations, according to trust and estate attorneys. The possible expiration next year of the estate and gift tax exemption, which currently lets couples give away up to $27 million tax-free, is also driving the creation of new trusts. Fears of a global wealth tax, the  IRS crackdown on wealthy taxpayers  and a wave of foreign millionaires and billionaires using the U.S. as the latest offshore tax haven are also fueling demand. In the race among states to attract the hundreds of billions of dollar in new trust assets, Nevada has a comfortable lead. Its legislature frequently updates its trust laws and regulations to make them more attractive. Nevada has no state income tax, no corporate income tax and no inheritance tax, which helps trusts grow in value without having a chunk taken out. Its secrecy laws are also among the strictest in the country. In 2009, the legislature passed a law stating that any records submitted to the Division of Financial Institutions are confidential. While all trust cases in Nevada are officially part of the public record, filing attorneys can use a new 2023 law to keep the trust name, settlors and beneficiaries confidential without a court order. Adding to the confidentiality, it is one of seven states that allow silent trusts, which permit the trustee to keep the existence of the trust from the beneficiaries under the trust terms. Nevada is also unusual in having no exception creditors  meaning even ex-spouses, child support claims or lawsuit plaintiffs cant gain access to a trust. Perhaps its most powerful advantage, and the one with direct bearing on the Murdoch case, is trust flexibility. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  At the center of the Murdoch case is the Murdoch Family Trust, which holds the powerful voting shares in  News Corp.  and  Fox Corp.  that effectively control the companies. (The trust also contains the family farm in Australia, the Murdoch art collection and its  Disney  shares.) Under the arrangements current terms, when Rupert Murdoch dies, control of the trust would pass to four of his children: Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence. Each would get one vote, meaning no sibling could gain control without the others. The trust was created as an irrevocable trust, meaning its designed to be permanent. Yet according to  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal , Rupert Murdoch has moved to rewrite the trust to give Lachlan control after Ruperts death. He argues that its in the best financial interests of the other children, which at least some of them have challenged. Spokespeople for News Corp. and Fox declined to comment. Changing an irrevocable trust is virtually impossible in many states. Yet in Nevada, its common, thanks to a special carve-out known as decanting. The state allows irrevocable trusts to be decanted, or changed, into a new trust as long as certain provisions are met. In the case of the Murdoch dispute, Rupert will have to prove to a probate court that he is acting in good faith and for the sole benefit of the heirs. In Nevada, you can usually fix those things fairly easily, said Elyse Tyrell, a probate lawyer with Tyrell Law PLLC in Henderson, Nevada. Trust and estate attorneys in Nevada said its slightly unusual for a trust donor  in this case Rupert Murdoch  to argue that hes acting in the interests of heirs who are opposing him. Yet if he can make the case that Lachlans control would maximize the financial value of News Corp. and Fox Corp., and therefore benefit all the siblings, the court may take his side. The trial starts in September. Its also unusual for a family to be able to create a trust in Nevada without business or personal ties to the state. Residing in Nevada is not a requirement for establishing a trust. None of the Murdochs appear to own any homes in Nevada, and none of their businesses have any public headquarters there. Normally a family would have some ties in Nevada to establish trust, either living here or having real estate, Tyrell said. I dont believe any of the Murdochs ever lived here."

        "content": "Dolce and Gabbana's luxury perfume for dogs  costing over $100  has sparked concerns from some animal welfare organizations. The Italian fashion house's alcohol-free fragrance mist for dogs, which costs 83 ($105) on its U.K. website, is inspired by Fef, the pet dog of brand-owner Domenico Dolce. The scent blends \"fresh and delicate notes of Ylang Ylang, Musk, and Sandalwood\" and comes in a green lacquered glass bottle with a 24-carat gold-plated paw on it, according to the product page on the  company's website . Fef can be applied directly to a dog's body  avoiding the nose area  or sprayed onto a pet owner's hands and then brushed or rubbed into a dog's fur. Dolce and Gabbana said its new product has been certified as suitable for animal use by the Safe Pet Cosmetics program. However, the fragrance has drawn some concern from animal welfare organizations and experts who warn that perfumes can interfere with a dog's sense of smell. Britain's RSPCA warned against anthropomorphizing dogs by attributing human characteristics to them, blurring the line between what humans and dogs like. \"Dogs rely on their sense of smell to communicate and interact with their environment as well as the people and other animals within it,\" said RSPCA Senior Scientific Officer Alice Potter in a statement. \"Therefore we advise that strong-scented products such as perfumes or sprays are avoided, especially as some smells can be really unpleasant for dogs.\" Donald Maurice Broom, professor of animal welfare at the Cambridge Veterinary School, said a product like Fef could have a negative effect on dogs if present for more than a few minutes. \"The dog's world is full of subtle odour information about other dogs, humans, food and potential danger. A strong odour would mask much of this so would have negative effects on the dog. It would be like the dog trying to distinguish visually when kept in a blindingly bright light,\" Broom said via emailed comments. However, the professor noted that when dogs are exposed to some sweet-smelling oils like lavender for a short period of time, it can be calming for dogs. Oils such as ylang ylang which is included in Fef, can also have a positive effect, he said. RSPCA's Potter also noted that some \"lightly-scented products,\" which do not use aversive scents or interfere with a dog's sense of smell, can have a calming effect. \"We know that owners want to show their dogs how much they care about them and treat them to presents for occasions such as their birthdays, but we'd always suggest choosing a gift that is fun and enriching for their pet, such as a new toy or tasty treats,\" Potter said. Dolce and Gabbana declined to comment on the concerns raised by animal experts."

        "header": "India's ultra-wealthy club is booming \u2014 here's where the country's rich are investing ",
        "content": "India is expected to see the fastest growth in ultra high net worth individuals globally over the next few years,  according to consultancy Knight Frank . Earlier this year, India's financial center,  Mumbai, overtook Beijing to become Asia's leading billionaire hub . Globally, the city ranks third on billionaire count, after New York and London. India's ultra-wealthy population   people with a net worth of at least $30 million rose 6.1% to 13,263 in 2023 from the prior year. This number is expected to surge 50.1% by 2028, marking the fastest growth in UHNWIs in the world, according to Knight Frank. So, where are India's growing ultra-rich investing their wealth? About 30% of India's UHNWI investments go into luxury real estate, including overseas projects, said Alok Saigal, president and head of wealth management firm Nuvama Private. People have moved away from investing in land as it is less liquid, and more wealth has been allocated to residential real estate since the pandemic, he added. On average, an UHNW Indian owns more than two homes, and around 12% of India's super rich plan to buy a new house in 2024, data from the Knight Frank's wealth report showed. India's ultra rich are also buying expensive real estate overseas, with Dubai being a favorite, said Chethan Shenoy, executive director at wealth management firm Anand Rathi Wealth. \"Dubai has all the Indian entertainment, Indian food  but just sophisticated. It's a more sophisticated Mumbai, more sophisticated Delhi,\" he said.  Around 20% of Dubai's offshore real estate  pie is owned by Indian investors. These luxury residential real estates tend to the vacation homes for the rich, or are rented out, and may also be flipped, the two experts said. \"Offshore has become a fairly significant and relevant topic for Indians today. So people are looking to move some part of their assets abroad or seek global exposure. And again, real estate becomes the starting point,\" Saigal said. Investing in startups is becoming increasingly popular, especially with the younger generation of rich Indians, wealth managers told CNBC. Over the last 15 to 20 years, a lot of India's young people studied abroad, expanding their exposure, building networks, and then returning to run their own businesses or invest in startups, Saigal said. \"Their friends have started their startups. So investing with their friends, putting money into these startups has become one big thing for them,\" he added. Investing in early stage companies is also another means of diversifying their portfolios, said Nitin Chengappa, managing director andhead of the affluent banking and distribution network at Standard Chartered Bank. India's UHNWIs are in general turning to startup investments as a \"dynamic strategy for wealth creation,\" positioning themselves to capture significant returns in high-growth sectors such as fintech, healthcare and technology, Chengappa said. Consumer goods startups are a favored lot as these investors increasingly eye a slice of India's consumption boom pie, said Anand Rathi Wealth's Shenoy. \"They are now wanting to invest into companies that are bringing out goods which are unique, they want to be a part of the next big story in India,\" he said. As the number of middle to high-income households increases, India's consumer market is positioned to become the world's third largest by 2027,  according to estimates by Fitch Solutions' BMI . India is expected to add 180,000 startups by 2030, alongside 280 unicorns, according  estimates of startup information provider Inc42 estimates . As of the end of 2023, India had  117,254 startups   an exponential  increase from the 350 in 2014 . India's wealthy are also actively pursuing alternative investment opportunities, Standard Chartered's Chengappa said. \"UHNWIs typically have the resources to achieve a higher degree of diversification across a broader range of asset classes, geographic regions, and investment strategies,\" he said. This means their portfolios tend to have more exposure to alternative investments such as luxury items. About 17% of India's UHNWIs' wealth goes into luxury goods, with jewelry, art and watches as top preferences, findings from Knight Frank revealed. These alternatives tend to have intrinsic value and can be enjoyed personally while appreciating over time, the Chengappa said, adding that investments such as jewelry and art also hold cultural significance and can be viewed as status symbols. Equities remain a favored asset class for India's rich due to their potential for high returns, experts said. \"The main investment asset class for the super-rich still remains equity stocks and equity mutual funds,\" said K. Joseph Thomas, head of research at Emkay Wealth Management. The general uptrend in the Indian markets is closely linked to the country's GDP growth and liquidity inflows, particularly into the mid- and small caps, he said. The wealthy investors have substantial allocations in blue-chip stocks, high-growth mid-cap companies and sector-specific investments like pharmaceuticals and technology, said Standard Chartered's Chengappa."

Jeff Bezos has been making headlines for his big-ticket purchases  from a $165 million estate in Los Angeles and a $177 million property on Miami's Indian Creek to his $500 million yacht. Yet, Bezos' biggest recent buying binge may be in artificial intelligence, through his family office. All of the investments made this year by Bezos' family office  called Bezos Expeditions  have been in artificial intelligence, according to exclusive data provided to CNBC by FINTRX, a private wealth intelligence platform. While the amounts he invested are not disclosed, Bezos Expeditions participated in funding rounds totaling more than $1 billion. In January, the  Amazon  founder and executive chairman invested in the $73.6 million Series B round of Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine company. He also invested in a $63 million follow-on round in April. The value of Bezos Expeditions' January investment likely doubled by April, since the company says its valuation soared to between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. In February, Bezos Expeditions invested in Figure AI, the humanoid-robot company that also counts  Nvidia  and  Microsoft  as investors. The venture round totaled $675 million. In July, he invested in a $300 million Series A round of Skild AI, which is focused on making AI systems for machines and robotics devices.

Bezos Expeditions has always tilted heavily toward tech. Fully 70% of his family office investments are in technology, according to FINTRX. The next-biggest category is consumer goods, at 16%, followed by financial services and manufacturing, both at 13%. But now, his primary focus seems to be AI. In a podcast interview in January, Bezos said AI tools are \"not inventions, but discoveries\" that will have profound effects on technology and change. \"These powerful tools are much more likely to help us and save us even than they are to unbalance, hurt us and destroy us,\" he said. Bezos has plenty of company among family offices. According to the UBS Global Family Office Report, AI is now the favorite investment category for family offices. More than three-quarters, or 78%, of family offices surveyed plan to invest in AI in the next two to three years  the most for any category. Amazon has also been ploughing money into AI. The company plans to invest more than $100 billion in data centers over the next decade and invested $4 billion in Anthropic, the AI safety and research firm. Bezos recently filed a stock-sale plan to unload another $5 billion worth of Amazon shares this year, after selling $8 billion worth earlier this year. With more than $13 billion in cash, Bezos will now have even more money to bet on the AI boom."

        "header": "UAE set to welcome even more millionaires as wealthy individuals abandon the UK",
        "content": "The United Arab Emirates is on track to be the  world's top wealth magnet  for the third year running, according to the  Henley Private Wealth Migration Report . At the same time, the U.K.  already the source of many of the UAE's expatriates  is projected to see its millionaire population  drop by 17%  by 2028, according to Swiss bank UBS. High-net worth individuals are in many cases voting with their feet, seeking greener pastures  or in the case of tax-free expat hubs like Dubai, sandier beaches  as costs and taxes rise in their home country. The trend is likely to accelerate in the wake of the landslide election victory for the U.K.'s Labour Party in June, according to some financiers. \"There are push and pull factors for this trend of millionaires opting to relocate to Dubai,\" Karim Jetha, a longtime regional investor who relocated to the UAE from the U.K. during the pandemic, told CNBC. \"Push factors include the prospect of higher taxes under a new Labour government. For example, one of Labour's campaign pledges was to levy VAT on private school tuition, which would raise the cost by 20%,\" he said. \"Pull factors include Dubai's perception of being extremely safe and visa reforms that encourage migration.\" The UAE is set to see a record net inflow of 6,700 millionaires from around the world by the end of 2024, according to the Henley report, which was released in June. That's nearly double the second-ranked country on the list, the U.S., which is expected to welcome a net inflow of 3,800 millionaires in the same time frame. \"With its zero income tax, golden visas, luxury lifestyle, and strategic location, the UAE has entrenched itself as the world's number one destination for migrating millionaires,\" the report said. The UAE's golden visa is a long-term residence visa that allows foreign residents to live, work or study in the UAE. While the millionaires migrating to the UAE most commonly come from India, the wider Middle East, Russia, and Africa, a larger number of Brits and Europeans are expected to move to the glitzy desert emirate as well, it added. Development and reforms in the UAE's \"wealth management ecosystem\" are to thank for much of this, said Sunita Singh-Dalal, partner at the Hourani Private Wealth & Family Offices in Dubai. \"In less than five years, the UAE has introduced a robust regulatory framework that provides the wealthy with a range of innovative solutions to protect, preserve and enhance their wealth,\" she said. Factors such as modern infrastructure and a robust international school system, geographical connectivity, low crime, no income tax, the remote worker visa and a number of investment incentives also help attract the wealthy to Dubai. Britain, by contrast, is set to see its millionaire population drop from 3,061,553 last year to 2,542,464 by 2028, the UBS Global Wealth Report, which came out in June, forecast. But it's important to note that the U.K.'s large millionaire population  the third-highest in the world  includes many foreign residents from places like Russia, the Middle East and elsewhere. Now that the U.K. government is phasing out its  \"non-dom\" status   which allowed wealthy and often foreign residents not to pay British taxes on overseas income  much of that population will be looking to drop their U.K. residencies. \"The outflow already generated by the economic and political turmoil in Britain risks being accelerated by further unwelcome policy decisions,\" Hannah White, director of the independent think tank the Institute for Government in London, commented in the Henley report. She pointed to the 40% duty already in effect on estates above a threshold of 325,000 ($417,755), as well as the ending of the UK's non-dom tax regime starting in 2025. The current Labour government has also pledged to drop the exemption for a 20% VAT charge on Britain's private school tuition fees, which would make education significantly more expensive for those sending their children to the elite institutions. \"Labour's commitment to remove their exemption from 20% VAT is a further unwelcome development,\" White said."

        "content": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Private jet flights fell 15% in the first half of the year compared with their peak in 2022, as the industry grapples with waning demand and a new competitive landscape for high-end travel. Despite a short boost from the Summer Olympics, with a record 713 private jet flights to Paris the last week of July, the private jet industry continues to lose altitude this travel season. Private jet charter flights dropped to 610,000 in the first half of the year, down from 645,000 last year and 716,000 in 2022, according to data from Argus International. The two-year decline highlights the ongoing correction in the world of private aviation, as the surge of new jet card members and charter fliers who started traveling private for the first time during Covid pulls back. Even ultra-wealthy travelers are showing signs of spending fatigue. \"During the peak, everyone was saying,'People who fly private for the first time will never go back to commercial,'\" said Rob Wiesenthal, CEO of  Blade Air Mobility,  the air charter and helicopter company. \"Well guess what? Many went back. And they're still going back.\" The industry is still ahead of 2019 levels, and experts say if you take out the aberrational spike in 2021 and 2022, business has been rising along its usual growth path. Yet the boom times of the post-Covid era created a wave of euphoria in the industry, ushering in a burst of IPOs and startups, and a mad scramble for jets and pilots. Now, many say, all that expansion is setting the stage for a shakeout.  The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  Wheels Up,  which went public in 2021 through a SPAC, saw its stock plummet more than 90% before  Delta Air Lines  stepped in to help rescue the company with an investment and partnership. Wheels Up has never made a quarterly profit and last week reported a second-quarter net loss of $97 million and a 29% year-over-year decline in members. The company's CEO, George Mattson, said Wheels Up is making solid progress and that, \"Our work this quarter further solidified our position at the forefront of delivering integrated global aviation solutions that seamlessly combine the previously separate ecosystems of private and commercial travel.\" Jet It, a large U.S. private jet operator, shut down last year after grounding its fleet of Phenom 300s, Gulfstream G150s and HondaJets. VistaJet has faced repeated concerns and media reports about its debt load, thoughfounderand Chairman Thomas Flohr told CNBC in May that \"all documents and data was always available to our equity and debt-holders.\" Industry experts say some of the smaller charter operators may soon face tough decisions, as fleets sit idle and demand falls. \"The smaller operators with three, four or five jets, they're the ones hurting,\" said Doug Gollan, founder and editor of   Private Jet Card Comparisons. The recent challenges and fleeting success in private aviation trace back to Covid. In 2020, as airports and airlines shut down, private jets offered an escape and safer way to fly. Wealthy travelers who had rarely, if ever, flown private due to the cost and energy consumption, could now justify isolating at 40,000 feet. There was this whole section of the population that could afford to fly private, but they were always reluctant because they didnt like the optics, said Jay Duckson, founder and president of consulting firm Central Business Jets. With Covid, they had a reason to fly private. You had a massive uptick in demand. The flood of liquidity from government spending, stimulus, low interest rates and a booming stock market also created record amounts of wealth to pay the soaring costs of flying private. Companies rushed to buy planes, hire pilots and sign up new members. Before 2019, there were only a few months where private jet charters topped 100,000. In 2021, almost every month exceeded 100,000, with July 2021 topping 300,000 flights. The demand overwhelmed the industry. Private jet passengers who paid six figures for flights started facing delays and cancellations as operators couldnt buy or lease planes fast enough. Shortages of pilots and parts also grounded fleets. In 2023, demand started to slide even as more planes and pilots started to come online. Some wealthy fliers felt they could no longer use Covid as an excuse  to themselves or to others  to fly private. For others, the soaring prices of flying private simply got out of hand. Prices are about 20% higher than they were in 2019, Private Jet Card Comparisons' Gollan said. A lot of people are saying, I spent $300,000 or $350,000 on flights last year, Im not going to spend $400,000 or $450,000 this year. Even if they have the money, they have a dollar figure in their head they dont want to go over. Along with reducing flights, some fliers simply started flying commercial for easy city-to-city trips, mixing both commercial and private throughout the year. In his latest survey of private jet fliers, Gollan found 87% switch between airlines and private, depending on where theyre flying. With demand lower, unsold planes are piling up again and prices are softening. The number of used business jets for sale jumped 17% in July compared with a year ago, according to a report from Jefferies. Prices fell 7%, according to the report. While orders for new jets remain strong, the wait times have fallen from as much as three or four years to about two years for many models, according to jet brokers. Many industry executives welcome the drop in demand, saying the industry is returning to a more balanced equilibrium, with profitable routes, available planes and happier customers. The industry is on a more sustainable long-term path, said Travis Kuhn, senior vice president of software at Argus. Its not a bad thing that its cooled down a bit. Gollan said that while some of occasional fliers may have drifted out of private aviation, the \"heavy users\" are still flying. His survey showed that 95% of those surveyed who started flying private during Covid are still flying privately, with 77% in a membership, jet card or fractional program. Industry giant NetJets, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has also benefited, as more people switched from charter to fractional ownership due to better reliability and quality. The number of fractional flights actually increased 12% in the first half of 2024, to 308,000, according to Argus. Some of these new fliers looked around and assessed the market, and they like the fractional model, Kuhn said. Its a set number of hours and a bigger fleet.

        "header": "Where are China's ultra-rich parking their wealth amid a slowing economy?",
        "content": "China's ultra-wealthy population  people with a net worth of at least $30 million  is expected to increase by almost 50% in a few years, according to projections in a  recent Knight Frank wealth report . At a time when China's economy is facing headwinds, and  growth has been slowing , where are the Chinese ultra-rich, whose numbers are expected to swell to 144,897 by 2028 from 98,551 in 2023, parking their wealth? The current investment direction of the wealthy Chinese is a \"conservative\" one, with their funds flowing into international assets against the backdrop of a stalling Chinese economy dragged by a beleaguered property sector, wealth managers told CNBC. However, the country's high-end property market remains a favored asset. \"There has been a noticeable increase in transactions within Shanghai's luxury real estate sector,\" said James Macdonald, head of China research at global real estate firm Savills, attributing it to a recent policy easing by the government. China has  relaxed several restrictions on property purchases , which has led to an increase in new high-end property launches in downtown locations, addressing pent-up demand, he added. In May, the government  reduced the number of years  people were required to pay tax in Shanghai before they could purchase property to three from five. Down payment ratios for first-time buyers have also been cut to 20% from 30%. Luxury residences, especially in Shanghai, have been a good investment for local high-net-worth individuals and rich families in recent years due to their scarcity, said Sam Xie, CBRE's head of research in China. According to data provided by Xie, the transaction volume for newly built residences priced at a minimum $2.75 million per unit grew38% year on year in the first quarter of 2024. Xie noted that 40% of these buyers were Shanghai's local residents. Luxury projects such as the Arbour in Shanghai's affluent shopping district Xin Tian Di, Greentown's The Bund Garden and the  Shanghai Arch in financial district Lujiazui , sold out immediately on launch, said Knight Frank Head of Asia-Pacific Research Christine Li. That said, China's luxury real estate market is still primarily concentrated in the core areas of first-tier cities, said Li. \"In the current landscape, luxury homes in Shanghai represent valuable assets for preserving wealth and liquidity, particularly for ultra-high-net-worth individuals,\" said Stephen Pau, chief investment officer at Hefeng Family Office. Other local investment classes, such as the wider property market and China-listed stocks are not as popular among the ultra rich, experts told CNBC. \"Chinese clients were traditionally overweight real estate and home-market equities,\" said Nick Xiao, CEO of Hong Kong-based multi-family office Hywin International. But these wealthy Chinese investors have come to embrace a growing and more diverse range of asset classes, including currencies, private credit, private equity, U.S. treasuries and developed market equities, Xiao told CNBC. \"To many Chinese clients, U.S. and Japanese equities offer participation in high-growth sectors and secular trends that won't reverse in the near term,\" he said. U.S. treasuries help them lock in historically high yields, and global private equity provides a layer of diversification on top of public market exposure, Xiao added. Similarly, Pau noted that the flow of money into international assets by wealthy Chinese is reflected in increasing allocations via Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors and Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership. QDII  is a scheme that allows financial institutions  to invest in securities outside of China.  QDLP is a program  that allows the local yuan to be converted to foreign currencies for overseas investments. \"This is consistent with the overall trend of investor defensiveness,\" said Pau, adding that wealthy Chinese are conservative due to the uncertainties in the domestic economy as well as the wider geopolitical environment. Pau noted the rich Chinese are shifting toward capital preservation and higher yielding, low-risk products such as U.S. treasuries, especially after having experienced losses in real estate and domestic equities. \"This contrasts with the more diversified investment approach of wealthy individuals in other parts of the world, who are often willing to allocate funds to mutual funds and multi-asset portfolios,\" he said. Compared to their global peers, rich Chinese investors have their wealth scattered across too many banks and brokers, without a consolidated overview to measure performance, Xiao highlighted. \"Some Chinese clients are struggling to select from the myriad of hedge fund strategies in the international space, due to lack of skills,\" he said. Others have yet to manage risks with a more comprehensive overview  incorporating macro, geopolitical and sectoral aspects into their investment decisions. This divergence in investment behavior highlights the distinct mindsets and risk appetites of mainland Chinese investors versus their international counterparts, Pau said. \"The former group [is] more inclined towards capital preservation and stable income generation, while the latter tend to embrace a more balanced, diversified approach to wealth management.\""

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Family offices are increasingly offering lucrative shares of equity and deal profits to staff amid a growing battle for talent, according to a top family office attorney.  As family offices surge in size and number, and compete more directly with private equity firms and venture funds for top staff, they're sweetening their compensation plans. Along with salaries and bonuses, many are now offering equity stakes and various forms of profit-sharing to give employees more upside and incentives. Patrick McCurry, partner at McDermott Will & Emery LLP based in Chicago, who works with single-family offices, said family offices have to adapt to a more competitive hiring landscape. \"There is a war for talent,\" McCurry said. \"Family offices are competing for talent against each other, and against traditional private equity, hedge funds and venture capital.\" Family offices, the private investment arms of single families, are also shifting to profit shares as a way to better align the incentives of the staff with the family. \"It helps get everyone rowing in the same direction,\" McCurry said. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  In an article in the latest UBS Family Office Quarterly, McCurry said there are three common ways single-family offices are paying staff with deal and equity plans. A profits interest gives an employee a share of upside in a deal or basket of deals. So if the family office buys a private company for $10 million and sells it for $15 million, the employee may get a share (say 5% or 6%) of the $5 million profit, or profit above a target or \"hurdle.\" If there is no profit, the employee gets no share. \"Basically they don't participate unless there is growth,\" McCurry said. They also save on taxes. Since the profit is a capital gain, the employee typically pays the long-term capital gains rate  which tops out at 20%  rather than the ordinary income rate, which can reach 37%. A co-investment allows an employee or group to put their own money in an investment, effectively investing in a deal alongside the family. Often the family will lend a portion of the money to the employee for the investment, known as a leveraged co-investment. So an employee may put $100,000 into an investment, borrow another $200,000 from the family, and get a $300,000 stake. If the deals make no profit, the employee loses their investment and potentially has to repay part of the loan. Family office owners like co-investments since it encourages employees to make less risky deals. They often pair co-investments with profit shares to create both upside and potential downside to staff. \"With co-invests you get a downside so you could get fewer 'moonshot' deals that would be high risk,\" McCurry said. If a family office is too complicated, with dozens of trusts, partnerships and funds that make it hard to issue profit shares or co-investments, they can sometimes offer phantom equity  notional shares of a basket of assets or fund or company that track performance without actual ownership.  Phantom equity can be like a 401(k) plan that's deferred tax free. But eventually it's usually taxed at ordinary income rates, so it can be less attractive to the employee. \"It's not as common, but it's mainly used for simplicity,\" McCurry said. Because they serve a single family, family offices have more flexibility than many companies when it comes to designing pay plans. Yet McCurry said family offices that want to compete for talent need to start offering more forms of equity. \"There is a crowd effect,\" he said. \"The more family offices start offering it, the more employees expect it. You don't want to be the outlier when everyone across the street is offering it.\" Sign up to receive future editions of Inside Wealth to your inbox."

        "content": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high net worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Sales of $100 million homes are on track to double this year, as surging financial markets and hopes for rate cuts fuel a recovery in the ultra-luxury real estate market, according to new reports. As of July 15, six homes in the U.S. have sold for more than $100 million, according to data from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. If the sales pace continues, it would more than double last year's total and likely eclipse the record of nine homes sold for over $100 million in 2021. Granted, the nine-figure club is a tiny group. But sales of homes priced at $50 million, $20 million and even $10 million are all signaling a strong rebound for the ultra-luxury real estate market after its decline in 2023. The comeback marks a stark contrast with the national housing market, which is still feeling the pressure of high mortgage rates and a lack of supply. \"It's a substantial uptick it the pace of sales, something we're not seeing at all in the broader housing market,\" said Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, the appraisal and research firm. Manhattan saw two blockbuster deals in roughly the past month. A penthouse at Central Park Tower  the tallest residential building in the world  closed for $115 million to an unknown buyer. And the penthouse of the Aman New York sold for a reported $135 million to Russian-born billionaire Vladislav Doronin, who founded the development company that built the building  effectively buying it from his own company. Palm Beach, Florida's only  private island, Tarpon Island , sold for $150 million in May, and Oakley founder James Jannard just sold his Malibu mansion for $210 million, making it the most expensive home ever sold in California. Even San Francisco is getting in on the ultra-lux boom. Laurene Powell Jobs, the billionaire widow of Steve Jobs, just bought the most expensive home ever sold in San Francisco. She paid $70 million for a 17,000-square-foot manse in Pacific Heights, wedged between neighbor Larry Ellison on one side and Apple design guru Jony Ive on the other. Signs of strength are also showing up further down the luxury ladder. According to Redfin, sales of homes priced at $5 million or more through June topped 4,000, up 13% compared with the same period last year. \"It was a much stronger and more robust start to the year than anyone expected,\" said Mike Golden, co-founder of Chicago-based @properties and of Christie's International Real Estate.  The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today .  According to the 2024 Mid-Year Luxury Outlook from Christie's, high-end markets around the country are seeing strong demand. In Naples, Florida, home sales over $10 million jumped 14% in the first quarter, according to the report. In Montana, sales over $4 million surged 50% through early May, according toPureWest Christie's International Real Estate. The artificial intelligence boom has sparked a resurgence in sales in the San Francisco Bay area. \"My biggest surprise thus far in 2024 has been just how many qualified buyers have the capacity and willingness to pay premium prices for ultra-elite properties, which speaks to the tremendous liquidity at the highest ends of the market,\" said Nathalie de Saint Andrieu, a broker in the Bay Area. The diverging paths of ultra-luxury and the broader housing market highlight the vastly different forces driving the high-end economy from the rest of the country. The national real estate market rises and falls with mortgage rates, with affordability at all-time lows and many Americans locked in their homes with low-rate mortgages. The ultra-wealthy can use cash to buy their homes, especially when rates are high. In Manhattan, two-thirds of deals this spring were in cash, with the share even higher for the luxury segment, according to Miller Samuel. What's more, the confidence (and cash) of wealthy homebuyers is largely driven by the stock market, which continues to shatter records this summer. With trillions of dollars in stock wealth being created, the ultra-wealthy are now looking to buy. \"The ultra-luxury segment is almost entirely disconnected from the typical housing market,\" Miller said. \"It's a more global than local market. And it's more of a barometer for the health of global financial markets.\" The surge in inheritances from the $80 trillion Great Wealth Transfer is also helping sales. Daniel de la Vega, president of One Sotheby's International Realty, said he's seeing a big surge in South Florida of millennial and Gen Z buyers who are purchasing condos with family trusts. \"They want new development, and some of them are coming in and buying sight unseen,\" he said. \"They especially like branded residences.\" De la Vega said another trend driving up ultra-luxury sales is demand for ever-larger homes. After Covid, he said, wealthy buyers want all their favorite lifestyle amenities in their homes  from gyms and spas to offices, entertainment spaces, and displays for their art and car collections. The price per square foot for luxury condos in South Florida is up 33% this year, to $3,451. Per-square-foot prices for single-family homes are up 11% to $2,485. \"It used to be that price per square foot went down as the property got bigger,\" de la Vega said. \"Now it's the opposite. We've never seen numbers like this. It's astronomical.\" Typically, the high-end real estate market takes a pause before presidential elections, as buyers wait for more certainty. So far, strong financial markets are outweighing any election concerns. Yet that's far from a done deal in the second half. \"At least by the actions we're seeing this year, the election doesn't seem to be weighing heavy on the super-luxury landscape,\" Miller said.

        "content": "As sea levels rise and storms intensify, coastal real estate is seeing flooding and erosion like never before. From Dana Point, California, to Long Island, New York, and Nantucket, Massachusetts, some of the nation's priciest coastal real estate is in an increasingly precarious position due to climate change. This year's hurricane season is already underway, and the forecast is for \"above-normal\" activity, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It predicts up to 13 hurricanes, with four to seven categorized as \"major\" storms. Various risk models have shown myriad projections for falling real estate values, but the effects of climate change are already hitting the market  and at a faster pace than most expected.  A Nantucket home listed last summer for just over $2 million sold early this year for just $600,000. A barely remarkable Nor'easter in the fall wiped away an astounding 70 feet of the beach it sits on, thanks to sea level rise and unusually intense rainfall. The buyer told The  Boston Globe,  \"the price mitigates the risk to a good degree.\" And it's not the only one. \"There have been several,\" said Shelly Lockwood, a real estate agent on Nantucket. \"One sold in the mid 7s, and one sold in the mid 8s, which I know that sounds like a lot of money, but those houses, if they weren't at erosion risk, would have sold for, I don't know, 10 or 12 million [dollars].\" Lockwood just launched a seminar for fellow agents to help them reprice homes at risk. \"I think we owe it is a duty to our clients to tell them what the risks are, and I was getting frustrated that that wasn't being communicated to my satisfaction, because I saw houses selling and I thought that's not worth that, it's falling in the ocean,\" said Lockwood. On the eastern end of Long Island, New York, in Montauk, a series of storms this winter had the community scrambling to bolster its beaches and protect its multimillion-dollar homes. The water was coming in faster than ever before. \"Where we've seen flooding in the past and the water subsiding right away, it's not subsiding anymore,\" said Kay Tyler, executive director of Concerned Citizens of Montauk. \"We have a friend that has a $10 million home, and he's not even sure what to do with it because if he sells it it's never going to be the $10 million he bought it for.\" Looking at ZIP codes just on the East and Gulf coasts of the United States, 33 have a median home value of at least $1 million. In just these areas a combined 77,005 properties are at significant flood risk, according to models by First Street, a climate risk data and analytics firm. That is roughly $100 billion in potential losses. Attorney Chris Farley is working with Nantucket homeowners to help reduce their property taxes, as both the beach and their home values erode. Some homes have been reassessed while their neighbors haven't. \"I think we just put our heads in the sand,\" said Farley. \"Values weren't going down until the last 10 years and it's still been kind of quiet reduction.\" Farley pointed to one property, which he said had an assessment of $2.2 million. It has not been assessed recently, but two others on the same street and seaside cliff have been reassessed  one for $500,000 and one for $250,000. The cliff is eroding badly. \"I would say 12-15 feet of sand is gone,\" Farley estimated, pointing to huge exposed geo tubes underneath the cliff. They should be covered in sand. \"They used to be able to walk down these steps right out and there was another stairway, it's gone. So they have no more access. To me that affects the value of the property when you can't even use the waterfront that you bought to be on,\" referring to the home that has yet to be reassessed. On another Nantucket beach, the rising ocean has pushed sand so far that it's burying homes. Sand covered two homes up to the windows and uncovered the septic system and utility wires. Once those are exposed, the town has to condemn the property, according to Lockwood. \"This was not like this last fall. This has happened this quickly,\" she said. Homeowner John Conforti lives just next to those two homes. Sand has risen so far it now covers his entire front yard. His deck, which used to have a stairway down to the yard, is now even with the sand. He has owned his home for 42 years and already moved it back from the beach once. \"We all say one more year,\" said Conforti. \"It's unbelievable what's happened. Lockwood estimates that without the new risks to the home from climate change, Conforti's home would be worth about $2.5 million. \"I don't know if you could sell it. Maybe five, maybe $500,000? Maybe. But you'd have to have some buyer willing to lose it,\" she added. As more and more homes lose value and see their property taxes reduced, the local economy could take a hit, meaning taxes for everyone could increase to make up the shortfall. Nantucket residents are also voting on which parts of the island need the most help  and who will pay for it. Meanwhile, in Montauk, experts are reassessing coastal resilience plans made nearly a decade ago after Superstorm Sandy, because they're already outdated due to climate change.

        "header": "Coastal land is sinking, doubling the potential damage from rising seas \u2014 here's why",
        "content": "A new study shows that coastal communities may be more at risk from sea-level rise than previously thought. That could have profound impacts on real estate, infrastructure and the U.S. economy. The sea level is rising as the earth heats and glaciers melt. At the same time, land is sinkinganother detrimental result of climate change. According to a new study from Virginia Tech and the U.S. Geological Survey, it is sinking as much as five millimeters a year in some areas. Sea-level rise is about three millimeters a year. \"What we found is that most of the land around the United States, and actually globally, is subsiding, is going down. And this downward motion is increasing the rate of the relative sea level rise at many locations around the world, specifically along the east coast of United States,\" said Manoochehr Shirzaei, Associate Professor of Geophysics and Remote Sensing at Virginia Tech. Shirzaei and his team used space-based radar satellites to build digital maps of land over many years to see where it is sinking most. They then built the first high-resolution maps of this, showing east coast land sinking anywhere from two millimeters to five millimeters per yearaffecting more than 2 million people and 800,000 properties. The study says that, when you add the sinking of the land to sea level rise, it doubles the frequency of flooding and cuts the time that cities and coastal residents have to prepare in half. That has consequences on the flood adaptation strategies that have already been developed. Areas including New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports are seeing land sink at more than 2 millimeters per year. \"So with sea level rise for example, at the rate of five millimeters per year, we have X number of years into the future to deal with that, to prepare for that doubling of the flooding frequency. Now imagine the same location land is subsiding at a rate of five millimeters per year,\" he said. In Baltimore, Maryland, so-called nuisance flooding is becoming more and more prevalent, due to sea-level rise and sinking land. \"When you have nuisance flooding, it's basically saying it's an inconvenience,\" said Grace Hansen, coastal planner for the City of Baltimore. \"But when you think of the promenade here as flooded, you know, some people can't get to businesses or they can't get to work.\" Coastal Baltimore is sinking by more than two millimeters per year, according to the study. \"And to me and you that doesn't seem like a lot by any means, but what becomes an issue is when it's not uniform, and you can have building foundation sinking faster than the other side of the building, and that's where you'll see the foundation is not stable,\" said Hansen. Climate change is causing drought, forcing us to pump more groundwater and build more dams to store water. \"Warmer temperatures and lower precipitation increase the demand for fresh water and the main source of that in most places is groundwater. So we pump the groundwater to meet that demand and this accelerates the land subsidence or sinking of the land due to the compaction of the aquifer,\" Shirzaei explained. In addition, dams are built to save water and generate electricity. In the transition to cleaner energy, electricity demand is increasing dramatically. These dams reduce the supply of sediment to coastal areas and cause them to be sediment-starved. As a result, the land sinks even further. \"In terms of groundwater extraction, that is primarily one of the reasons why Baltimore is sinking,\" said Hansen. More than six dams surround Baltimore. Even as water becomes more scarce, Shirzaei says we need to mitigate the sinking of the land in the next decade, or it will severely impact the integrity of buildings and infrastructure. \"It would affect bridges, pipelines, railways, runways of airport, and that will translate into trillions of dollars of loss and cost of the repair,\" he said. Some of Shirzaei's suggestions include recycling water by treating wastewater and sewage, putting wider restrictions on water usage, especially in landscaping, and capturing rain and banking it better. One project in Virginia is pumping groundwater back into aquifers and treating it in wastewater plants. Whatever the option, he says, the sinking needs to stop.

        "header": "Shipping industry could lose $10 billion a year battling climate change by 2050",
        "content": "Severe drought has caused water levels in the Mississippi River to drop so low that ships have been running aground. To keep commerce flowing, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is now using a dredge ship to push out silt in the river near Vicksburg, Mississippi. The chief of navigation for the corps told local media the low water level can cause a major financial impact. It is just the latest in a growing number of disruptions hitting the shipping industry as it battles the effects of climate change. In the Panama Canal this past summer, severe drought caused authorities to reduce the daily number of ships traversing it, resulting in severe backups that hit supply chains. At the end of September, they did it again. A similar reduction in 2019 cost global shipping as much as $370 million, according to a study by RTI International. That same year, record low water levels in the Mississippi River disrupted transportation of agricultural goods, costing about $1 billion in losses. In October 2021, 109 containers were washed overboard during a rare, so-called \"bomb cyclone\" off Vancouver Island, Canada. All of this is not lost on Maersk, the world's second-largest container ship company. \"We firmly believe that climate change poses a great threat to the shipping industry and the consumer overall. We are definitely seeing disruption, disruption happening all the time,\" said Narin Phol, Maersk's president for North America. About 90% of traded goods are carried over water, and maritime trade volume is expected to triple by 2050 as demand increases. This shift comes as shipping is at increasing risk from tropical storms, inland flooding, sea level rise, drought and extreme heat. \"Imagine that if the port has an impact, but that we are not able to unload the cargo here, there's a downstream impact to the supply chain, and also towards the upstream. So, it's all connected,\" Phol said. The impacts of climate change on ports alone, from damage to disruption, could cost the shipping industry up to $10 billion annually by 2050 and up to $25 billion per year by 2100, according to the RTI study, which was reviewed by the Environmental Defense Fund. Of all the transportation sectors, shipping is one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Whether it's out at sea, in rivers or canals, or even coming into port. But shipping is also one of the slowest to cut carbon emissions. In September, Maersk unveiled its first containership powered by green methanol, which emits less carbon dioxide than traditional vessels. Twenty-four more such ships are coming, but the fuel is both expensive and scarce. \"The technology, you could say, it's ready, it's there. But it's a major shift that is needed, and it will take a lot of time,\" said Hakan Agnevall, CEO of Wartsila, a global technology and energy company that builds engines for the marine industry. \"Even if we have engines ready for new fuels, the fuel needs to be produced, there needs to be significant investments made, and it needs to be green fuels; it means it needs to be produced by green energy,\" Agnevall said. Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but it took until this past July for the international industry to finally agree to a net zero goal by 2050. \"It's actually a big step compared to where countries wanted to go five years ago, but even with this big step, it's not  the goals that have been set will not bring us to the Paris Agreement, not bring us to the 1.5 degrees [Celsius], so it's a step in the right direction but it's not enough,\" Agnevall said. In the meantime, the industry is focusing more on both resilience and planning. Maersk is changing its ship design and upgrading its weather-monitoring systems. Wartsila is turning to artificial intelligence, using digital solutions to combine weather forecasts, climate data and logistics data to deal with potential disruptions and disasters. \"It's not only about the routing, it's also how you plan together with the ports to make sure that, with increased uncertainty, we really leverage the digital tools to do the best we can,\" Agnevall added.

        "header": "Abandoned coal mines may be gold mines for geothermal energy",
        "content": "The Biden Administration recently  announced  nearly half a billion dollars from both the Inflation Reduction and Infrastructure laws would go toward clean energy projects at former coal mines. Some will be solar farms at the sites, but there is a lesser known opportunityinsidethe mines: Geothermal energy. Abandoned coal mines generally fill with water when the mining has ceased. That water contains heat from far below the earth's surface. People can drill bore holes to bring that heat to the surface, then pass it through heat exchanges and heat pumps in buildings and in homes. The first neighborhood mine-water heating scheme in Great Britain just went into full operation at the end of March and will eventually serve over 1,200 homes. \"Each minable scheme poses its different challenges, and there will be expenses involved with drilling bore holes or laying district heat network pipes in the ground,\" explained Gareth Farr, head of heat and by-product innovation at the Coal Authority in Mansfield, England. \"But hopefully most of these schemes, if not all of them, will be able to operate at a similar or better cost to the traditional fossil-fuel heating schemes we have at the moment.\" Geothermal energy is not new, but taking it from abandoned coal mines is not yet common, especially in the United States. Professor and director of the Environmental Studies Program at Ohio University, Natalie Kruse-Daniels, and her students are studying abandoned mines in Appalachian Ohio to see which ones are close enough to towns to be used for home heating. \"It's this untapped energy source that could reduce bills, that could make energy more efficient, that could reduce some reliance on fossil fuels,\" said Daniels, who has been fascinated with coal mines since childhood. Geothermal energy from coal mines can be used not only to heat homes and buildings, but also to cool them. That opens up many more opportunities, especially for data centers. They are some of the worst carbon offenders, using vast amounts of energy and requiring thousands of gallons of water to cool themselves. Now, researchers in Scotland are studying how hot air from data centers can be pumped into coal mines and then recovered from the water to heat other buildings. \"We can store heat in mines, and we do hope that actually this could become part of vital heat storage. Storage is key, of course, for a lot of renewable energies,\" explained Farr. Coal fields run under at least 20 states in the U.S.  In Ohio there are more than 4,000 abandoned mines, a wealth of opportunity for geothermal energy. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy reported that the amount of water currently being discharged from underground coal mines in just the Pittsburgh coal seam could potentially be used to heat and cool roughly 20,000 homes. So why isn't it happening? Kruse-Daniels said that while it is a relatively inexpensive form of clean energy, the location and legacy may be liabilities. \"I think some of it's out of sight, out of mind, right? When we look at investment in new technology and investment in clean energy in Appalachia, it's limited,\" said Kruse-Daniels.  Coal is controversial, so investors don't target the coal regions, which, she says, is a mistake. \"In a less predictable climate and in a warmer world, this opens up an opportunity for turning this legacy, this liability, into a resource,\" she added.

        "header": "Tornado alley is widening, putting millions more people and properties at risk",
        "content": "The threat of tornadoes is rising as the weather conditions that create them are becoming more frequent and widespread due to global warming, experts say. That means a lot of areas that rarely see these storms are now in their paths. The U.S. experienced six times more billion-dollar severe storms in the past decade than in the previous two decades, according to  Climate Central . Those are the storms that produce tornadoes. So far this year, tornadoes have taken at least 58 lives across 10 states, already surpassing the annual average. Much of that is because the season is starting earlier, and tornado alley is expanding due to a warmer climate. \"Northeast Texas, eastern Oklahoma, the Arkansas River Valley, the mid-South, these areas are expected to see a near doubling of storms that produce tornadoes,\" said Walker Scott Ashley, professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University. Tornadoes need four ingredients to form, explained Ashley: moisture, instability (which provides the energy necessary for the storms), wind shear and lift. The first two are expected to increase significantly in a warming climate. \"It makes a lot of sense. If we heat up the oceans, if we heat up the earth's atmospheric system, we're going to have more moisture in that system, and that leads to more moisture for the storms, but also greater instability,\" Ashley said. When a powerful F-4 tornado plowed through Rolling Fork, Mississippi, in March, residents were largely unprepared. The area had not seen a tornado in over half a century. \"We didn't have very many tornadoes. The only one that I can remember is 1971, and the tornado bypassed Rolling Fork. It didn't actually hit,\" said Eldridge Walker, the mayor and a native of Rolling Fork, which has a population of just under 1,800 people. When the March storm hit, the city had only one tornado siren, and some residents said they didn't hear it. There are now plans to add two more. \"It's pretty clear that things are happening, which means as a city, as a community, as a homeowner, that folk need to be serious, a little bit more serious-minded about being prepared,\" Walker said. The difference between tornados coming through typical tornado alley, such as Kansas, and coming through Mississippi, is simply density.The states have almost the same exact populations, but Mississippi is roughly half the size of Kansas. \"There are more things, more people, more of us and more of our possessions in the mid-South,\" said Ashely. \"You combine that with an extreme socioeconomic vulnerability, and that is increased poverty rates and lack of sheltering and poor, in many cases, substandard housing the recipe is for disaster across some of these areas.\" The majority of residents in Rolling Fork had neither homeowners nor renters insurance, according to Walker. That's precisely why the widening of tornado alley is fast becoming a new focus for insurers. \"If we continue on the trend that we're going, that means that these economic losses are going to become in the hundreds of billions of dollars in a calendar quarter,\" said John Dickson, president of insurer Aon Edge, a division of  Aon . \"We need to make sure that we have an infrastructure, we have a capital mechanism, that we have a connected community mechanism to be able to respond to these events.\" But it's all happening, Dickson said, at a time when insurance dollars are diminishing. \"So, insurance capital becomes a precious finite commodity, prices go up, coverage changes, coverage options begin to be tighter and deductibles go up,\" he added. Global reinsurer capital declined 17%, or $115 billion, to $560 billion during the first nine months of 2022, according to Eric Andersen, president of Aon, in March 2023 testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget. As a result, reinsurers are raising prices, limiting coverage and even exiting some markets to improve returns. Both State Farm and Allstate have  stopped writing homeowners insurance in California  due to the rising risk of wildfires. In a May release, State Farm said it made the decision \"due to historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure and a challenging reinsurance market.\""

        "content": "They are majestic and beautiful and critical to the world economy. Coral reefs, often called the \"rainforests of the sea,\" support roughly 25% of all known marine species. They are vital not just to sea life, but to human life. And the planet has lost half its coral reefs since the 1950s due in large part to climate change. The total economic value of coral reef services for the united states alone, including fisheries, tourism, and coastal resilience, is over $3.4 billion annually, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That includes $1.8 billion a year in flood protection benefits from averting damage to property and economic activity. The annual value of U.S. commercial and recreational fisheries dependent on coral reefs is $200 million.  Now, an unlikely pair is teaming up not to save existing reefs but to create new more resilient reefs: Marine scientist Dr. Deborah Brosnan of the Ocean Shot Project, and John Paul DeJoria, co-founder of John Paul Mitchell hair care systems and Patron Spirits. Brosnan has been studying coral reefs for more than 25 years, with a specific focus on the Caribbean. \"Coral reefs are at risk. We have lost more than a third of coral reefs already,\" Brosnan told CNBC. \"And the prognosis for losing more is high. So right now today, we lose more coral reefs in a day than we can restore in a decade.\" Coral reefs are one of the most important ecosystems on the planet, according to Brosnan, who explained that while they occupy a fraction of the sea floor, they support more than half a billion people a day. A living coral reef will break 95% of a wave's energy, which means it creates a calm lagoon and protects us from storm surge. Reefs are mitigating sea level rise. Brosnan's solution is not to restore damaged reefs, but rather replace them with manmade reefs designed to be far more resilient to climate change. \"We came up with the technology to figure out the shape that a reef should be and the size that the reef should be in order to promote biodiversity and to protect the coastline,\" explained Brosnan. The reefs are made of a PH-neutral concrete  calcium carbonate, which mimics the natural makeup of reefs. It's a dead skeleton, but then the team attaches corals grown in a nursery  300 of them from 3 different species. Fish then move in. Last fall, the first project was installed off the coasts of Antigua and Barbuda. It was neither easy nor cheap, but Brosnan found a billionaire backer, DeJoria, to fund the project, which cost about $1 million. \"It's my way of paying a little bit of rent for being here on the planet earth,\" said DeJoria, who has a real estate project on Barbuda. \"I'm doing a billion-dollar project of fine beautiful homes. Incredible. It's a big project,\" he explained. \"The people, they are very wealthy people, and they love the fact that everybody's getting a good job, making good money, and that we're bringing the reefs back.\" While DeJoria touts the jobs he'll bring to the islands, restoring the reefs has a much wider economic impact. \"When you lose a coral reef, you lose extraordinary beauty, so when that disappears, tourism goes down because it's not a nice place to go. Added to that the fisheries. Coral is vitally important for fisheries,\" said Brosnan. Brosnan and DeJoria intend to build a facility on Barbuda to manufacture these reefs, which could then be installed anywhere around the world. They have two more ready to go. The technology is there, but the ability to scale it is a larger financial hurdle. \"The question is, will the world listen?\" asked Brosnan. \"This is very doable. This is doable in the region, it is doable globally. What we need is the investment in the technology, the investment in the deployment, and the recognition that there is a return on that investment in terms of our own health, our own safety on the coast, and the livelihood of at least a billion people on the planet.\"  "

        "content": "Global warming has already caused irreversible damage to the earth's ecosystems and communities, according to a  critical report  just issued from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The damage is extending to the U.S. housing market, which just saw unprecedented snow and flooding in California, as well as unusual winter tornados in the south. All that came after one of the worst hurricanes on record in Florida last year.  These changes have profound implications for the nation's nearly $12 trillion mortgage market. Hurricane winds are getting stronger, common storms are getting wetter, wildfires are spreading faster and millions of U.S. homes sit in the path of all of it. But the housing market currently doesn't price that climate risk into home values. U.S. homes exposed just to flood risk may now be overvalued by roughly $200 billion, according to research recently published in the journal  Nature Climate Change .  Fannie Mae, which backs more than 40% of all residential mortgages, could face much of that risk. The mortgage giant's chief climate officer, Tim Judge, says mortgage underwriting does not currently account for climate risk. So he is mounting a major effort  really a defense  to figure out the exact climate risk to Fannie Mae's balance sheet, so that it can ultimately incorporate that risk into mortgage underwriting.  \"I think there's still more that we have to do, and I think we just don't have the analytics yet to do it,\" said Judge. To help, Judge is hiring climate risk modeling firms, such as  First Street Foundation  and  Jupiter Intelligence , as well as others, to figure out just how to factor climate risk into home values and mortgage underwriting. First Street, for example, looks at climate risk from floods, fire and wind, and brings it down to an individual property level. Jupiter studies neighborhoods and communities. But the work can't come fast enough. New research from CoreLogic shows that on the current climate trajectory, the estimated number of U.S. homes significantly impacted by climate-related disasters will rise from less than a million in 2030 to over 62 million by 2050. In value, that's losses of just under $200 million to close to $9 billion in any given year. Consumers are largely unware of potential future costs from climate-related disasters. Mortgage lenders are also struggling to figure out the financials. \"It is a massive challenge for all of us to really think about,\" said Kristy Fercho, head of mortgage lending at  Wells Fargo. She also says climate risk may need to be factored into mortgage underwriting. \"To date, it hasn't. I think it's something that we're evaluating like the industry is,\" Fercho added. Fercho just finished a term as chair of the Mortgage Bankers Association, which issued a  special report  from its research institute in 2021 saying, \"Climate change may increase mortgage default and prepayment risks, trigger adverse selection in the types of loans that are sold to the GSE's [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac], increase the volatility of house prices, and even produce significant climate migration.\" Fercho agreed, \"It's certainly impacting how we're thinking about mortgages and what we need to do.\" The problem is the models from the different firms, as well as from government agencies like FEMA, all vary widely, and Judge says that has made the project harder than he expected.  So far, Judge says, Fannie Mae has learned that climate impact varies widely across the country but impacts vulnerable communities far more than affluent ones. It echoes the UN report, which found the impact of climate change is worst in the world's poorest nations and islands, which are home to about 1 billion people but account for less than 1% of greenhouse gas emissions. But Fannie Mae is not yet rejecting any mortgages based solely on climate risk. \"No, we're not there yet,\" he said. \"The first step is understanding what the damage will be to each property. The second step is how is that going to change our behavior? And how is that going to change valuation of properties? That's a lot of the work we have to do. Is it five years away? I'm not sure.\""

Now the rush is on to make the structures more resilient, but funding that will be a feat. The problem is particularly acute at the nation's Smithsonian museums. At the museum of American History, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., water is already rising. On a dry day, in the midst of two dry weeks, there was water down in the bowels of the building. As Nancy Bechtol, director of all Smithsonian facilities, explained, \"It's just groundwater.\" Bechtol is responsible for 13 million square feet of museum space, most on the Mall, which is below sea level, as well as two museums in New York City and one in Virginia. \"We're always sort of pre-planning and sort of staging different emergency responses just to be prepared so that our staff is prepared and that we have the planning in place,\" she said. Heavier rainfall is another pressing problem. Water from rain seeped into Smithsonian spaces after a major storm in 2006 and again last spring, when the American History Museum's cafeteria flooded with over a foot of water. None of the collection was damaged, but the Museum's director, Anthea Hartig, saw the writing on the hallowed walls.  \"We have collected almost 2 million objects. We have three linear miles of archival material that tell an unparalleled material story of our nation's remarkable past, so we're deeply committed to understanding how to retrofit the building, take care of the collections,\" said Hartig. In fiscal 2021, the Smithsonian had a $214 million budget, and Bechtol said she is using as much as she can for protection such as putting upflood walls around buildings, building rain gardens, buying sandbags, elevating backup generators, and constructing a whole new storagefacilityon higher ground in Suitland, Maryland, expected to break ground this year.Artifacts that are most at risk in museum basements on the Mall will be moved there. \"Even if I have to protect with plastic, I will protect with plastic,\" said Bechtol. She's not alone in the fight. Newwatersidemuseums in Miami and St. Petersburg, Florida, were built with special flood protections, and private funding isslowly starting to step up to protect older structures. The Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, devoted to supporting the legacy of the famed abstract painter, had committed $5 million over the next two to three years to invest in clean energy, energy efficiency, and climate resilience. \"We got 110 applications. That was with just six weeks of notice. Those 110 applications came in with people knowing exactly what to do and how they wanted to approach it,\" said Sarah Sutton, grant manager for the foundation's climate initiative.  So the foundation recently doubled the commitment to $10 million  now the largest private in climate resilience. \"No, it's not enough,\" said Sutton. \"This incredible commitment is only a drop in the bucket, but it's a demonstration that the museum sector is ready to deal with this problem.\" That money helped the California Indian Museum and Cultural Center implement wildfire protections for its structure, energy systems and air filtration, after after the J Paul Getty Museum came dangerously close to destruction in the 2019 fires around Los Angeles and Malibu. \"These collections do not depreciate over time. They increase in value, whether it's intellectual value or financial value. Guarding and protecting them for a long horizon into the future adds to their value to us, to the museum, and to the investors,\" said Sutton.  "

In just one day, the average data center could use 300,000 gallons of water to cool itself  the same water consumption as 100,000 homes, according to researchers at Virginia Tech who also estimated that one in five data centers draws water from stressed watersheds mostly in the west. \"There is, without a doubt, risk if you're dependent on water,\" said Kyle Myers, vice president of environmental health, safety & sustainability at CyrusOne, which owns and operates over 40 data centers in North America, Europe, and South America. \"These data centers are set up to operate 20 years, so what is it going to look like in 2040 here, right?\" CyrusOne is formerly a REIT, but was purchased this year by investment firms  KKR  and Global Infrastructure Partners. When the company moved into the drought-stricken Phoenix area, it used a different, albeit more expensive method of cooling. \"That was sort of our 'aha moment.' where we had to make a decision. We changed our design to go to zero consumption water, so that we didn't have that sort of risk,\" said Myers. Realizing the water risk in New Mexico,  Meta , formerly known as Facebook, ran a pilot program on its Los Lunas data center to reduce relative humidity from 20% to 13%, lowering water consumption. It has since implemented this in all of its center. But Meta's overall water consumption is still rising steadily, with one fifth of that water last year coming from areas deemed to have \"water stress,\" according to its website. It does actively restore water and set a goal last year to restore more water than it consumes by 2030, starting in the west. Microsoft  has also set a goal to be \"water positive\" by 2030. \"The good news is we've been investing for years in ongoing innovation in this space so that fundamentally we can recycle almost all of the water we use in our data centers,\" said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft. \"In places where it rains, like the Pacific Northwest where we're headquartered in Seattle, we collect rain from the roof. In places where it doesn't rain like Arizona, we develop condensation techniques.\" While companies with their own data centers can do that, so-called co-location data centers that lease to multiple clients are increasingly being bought by private equity firms in search of high-growth real estate. There are currently about 1,800 co-location data centers in the U.S., and that number is growing, as data centers are some of the hottest real estate around, offering big returns to investors. But the risk from drought is only getting worse. Just over half (50.46%) of the nation is in drought conditions, and over 60% of the lower 48 states, according to the latest reading from the  U.S. Drought Monitor . That is a 9% increase from just one month ago. Much of the west and Midwest in 'severe' drought. \"We need to innovate our way out of the climate crisis. The better we innovate the cheaper it becomes, and the faster we'll move to reaching these climate goals,\" added Smith. "

        "header": "Poor neighborhoods are hotter than rich ones \u2014 especially during heat waves",
        "content": "Poorer neighborhoods are hotter than wealthier ones. That's the overriding finding from the New York City component of a national project to map urban heat islands. Scientists have long known that urban areas generate heat, but until now they've not been able to map them street by street. On a searing summer day in New York city this past July, volunteers fanned out in cars with sensors to track heat and humidity. They traveled from the crowded tenements and truck-lined streets of the South Bronx to the open avenues of Manhattan's upper east side.  The heat trackers told a striking story. On one afternoon in July there was at least a 7 degree difference between the South Bronx, one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York city, and the Upper East Side of Manhattan, one of the wealthiest. The difference was even wider between the South Bronx and Central Park: Nearly 10 degrees. This kind of heat mapping is increasingly important as climate change causes global temperatures to rise and more people move to urban areas. The share of urban dwellers will grow from 55% today to 68% by 2050, according to the United Nations. In addition, as overall temperatures get hotter, the differences between the hottest and coolest areas grow larger, exacerbating divides by class and race.  \"We are getting extremely granular data. Street-level data. What right now exists is satellite data where it's New York City overall. It's one weather station that covers a vast area, but what we did was we went out and measured temperature along local roads,\" said Dr. Liv Yoon, a research scientist at Columbia University's Earth Institute. The data can help communities target their financial resources toward reducing temperatures by building more spaces, incorporating lighter colored rooftops, leaving more space between buildings and opening more cooling centers during heat waves. \"We want to empower the local citizen and scientists who participated so they own the data because often what we hear is they go to the authorities and they say, 'We're experiencing this problem, but they're often met with, 'You can't just come to us with anecdotes and emotions. We need hard data,\" explained Yoon. MelissaBarber, a Bronx native and founder of activist organization  South Bronx Unite , has fought for everything from community gardens to redesigning the Bronx waterfront to cool the area around it. Now, working with Yoon, she is using heat mapping to make a case for change to local officials and real estate developers. \"As community members who actually fight for justice, and social justice, and environmental justice, we can now say, \"There is actual data that says, 'We breathe different air.' There is actual data that says, 'We see and feel heat differently than everywhere else,'\" said Barber. \"Historically redlined areas certainly they have less infrastructure that is conducive to cooling. They have less green spaces,\" said Yoon, who spoke to CNBC one of the very few community gardens in the South Bronx -- a garden Barber helped create. Barber says data will give her more power to change real estate development across poorer parts of New York City. \"We need to really think about how we design communities. When we talk about historical injustice, and we talk about that redlining -- there weren't parks incorporated into that planning. There wasn't water incorporated into that planning. All of the buffers that actually allow us to experience climate differently did not exist and do not exist for many of our urban communities,\" said Barber. The temperature sensors were provided by Oregon-based CAPA strategies, a climate data and analytics firm that works with the federal government, local municipalities and non-profits.  \"It's really important because heat is one of the most insidious killers in cities. It kills more people than any other natural hazard,\" said Vivek Shandas, an advisor with CAPA. Shandas notes that climate change is upping the ante, increasing heat's effect on local economies, which now shut down more often due to deadly heat. \"We're seeing greater intensity of heat. We're seeing longer durations of those heat waves, and we're seeing more frequent heat waves come through, yet we're still using one single number to tell us what the temperature is for a city or a region,\" Shandas added. New York is one of 12 cities participating in this year's mapping campaign, which is in conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "

        "content": "As the severity, intensity and frequency of climate disasters increase, preparation is becoming more crucial than ever to protect lives, as well as infrastructure, businesses and local economies. One high-tech forecasting company is now stepping up, offering hyper-detailed weather prediction and pre-storm strategy plans, right down to a city block. Boston-based Tomorrow.io already boasts clients like  Delta ,  Ford ,  JetBlue ,  Meta ,  Raytheon ,  Uber ,  United Airlines , and the U.S. Air Force. Rainfall, snowfall, fire danger and air quality prediction are all part of the firm's capabilities. When the remnants of hurricane Ida blew into New Jersey almost a year ago, the state was woefully unprepared. It wasn't a hurricane anymore, so the preparation was minimal, but the deluge was incredible. \"It rained four inches in one hour during Ida, and we had a total of six and a half inches of rain, in one storm event, which is really unprecedented,\" said Caleb Stratton, chief resilience officer for the city of Hoboken, New Jersey. Hoboken, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, is only two square miles but home to more than 62,000 people. It is increasingly prone to flooding, so the city had   been building protection in the form of parks that act as massive drains. One of the parks sits atop a massive cistern that can hold 200,000 gallons of water and is managed remotely, so water can be held or released when necessary. But to optimize the system, city officials need to know what's coming. So just after Ida, they began working with Tomorrow.io. \"They are able to provide insights on when a storm event's going to occur  at what intensity, for how long  and they can do really block by block forecasts,\" said Stratton. The firm works with its clients well before they start forecasting to show them specifically how future weather will affect everything from operations to supply chains to staffing. \"We will take an airline's operating protocol, specifically upload it into our system, and then we have our own proprietary insights dashboard that tells them exactly when it's going to happen,\" said chief marketing officer Dan Slagen. \"So we'll tell an airline over the course of the week, these flights are going to be at risk of weather, and if you need to de-ice your planes, this is the time to do it, to avoid delays or any safety impacts.\" Next up, the firm is sending its own satellites into space, which will send back data far more frequently than government weather satellites."

        "header": "Developers are flooding Arizona with homes even as historic Western drought intensifies",
        "content": "California just experienced its driest January and February ever, and the snowpack is dangerously low. As the West enters its third year of drought,  water sources are drying up , and restrictions on the Colorado River are now hitting all sectors of the Western economy, including homebuilding. While there is a shortage of water, there is also a shortage of housing. The U.S. currently needs over a million more homes just to meet the current demand, according to an estimate by the National Association of Home Builders. Other estimates are even higher. As the millennial generation hits its prime homebuying years and Gen Z enters the fray, the supply of homes for sale is at a record low. Builders are hampered by high costs for land, labor and materials, so they are focused on the West and areas like the suburbs of Phoenix, which are growing rapidly. On a vast swath of land in Buckeye, Arizona, just west of Phoenix, the  Howard Hughes Corporation  is developing one of the largest master-planned communities in the nation,  Douglas Ranch , flooding the desert with housing. Howard Hughes CEO David O'Reilly says water will not be a problem. \"Every home will have low flow fixtures, national desert landscaping, drip irrigation and reclamation,\" he said, adding, \"we work with the local municipalities, the city of Buckeye, all the water districts, to make sure that we're enacting real conservation measures, not just at our property, but across the entire region.\" The community is projected to have more than a 100,000 homes, bringing in at least 300,000 new residents. Big public builders like  Pulte ,  Taylor Morrison ,  Lennar ,  DR Horton  and  Toll Brothers  have already expressed interest in building the homes, according to the Howard Hughes Corp. And it's just one of more than two dozen developments in the works around Phoenix, all as the West is in the midst of its  worst drought in more than 1,000 years . \"They're expecting the growth in this area to be a million people. And there isn't the water to sustain that growth. Not with groundwater,\" said Kathleen Ferris, senior water research fellow at Arizona State University. Ferris produced a documentary about the state's 1980 Groundwater Management Act. It requires developers to prove there is 100 years' worth of water in the ground on which they're building. Douglas Ranch sits on the Hassayampa Aquifer, which will be its primary source of water. \"And the problem is that with climate change there aren't backup water supplies that you can use to save a development that's based totally on groundwater. If it loses all of its water supply, there's no water to back that up,\" said Ferris. Mark Stapp is director of Arizona State University's real estate development program at the W.P. Carey School of Business. He points to various reservoirs that could replenish the groundwater, but admits there is still risk due to the sheer scale of development. \"I would say that there's a legitimate concern about our future, and policy-makers are very aware of this,\" said Stapp. O'Reilly argues that the current need for housing surpasses future concerns that could be unfounded. \"I don't think the answer is to tell people that are looking for an affordable home in Arizona, 'You can't live here, go somewhere else.' I think the responsible answer, the thoughtful answer, is to build them affordable homes, but to build it in a self-sustaining manner,\" O'Reilly said. A report  last spring from ASU's Kyle Center for Water Policy warned the amount of groundwater in the Hassayampa subbasin is considerably less than regulators estimate, and that without a change in direction, \" the physical groundwater supply under Buckeye will decrease and will not be sustainable.\" The report also says that hundred-year model for groundwater is constantly changing, especially given the changing climate. The state's department of water resources is now in the process of determining if the basin does in fact have a hundred years' worth of water. \"The bottom line is that there are places in this state, in this valley where there are sufficient water supplies to support new growth. We don't need to go way out in the desert and pump groundwater to build new homes,\" said Ferris. The land, of course, is cheaper out in the desert, but Ferris argues, \"Well, at some point there's a cost to that.\"  "

        "header": "Chicago is at risk as climate change causes wild swings in Lake Michigan water levels",
        "content": "The Great Lakes are often called the nation's third coast, and the past five years in the region have been the wettest on record. While the lakes don't exactly correlate to rising sea levels, Chicago now sits in just as precarious a position as oceanfront cities. Heavier rainfall and more frequent droughts are now causing extreme swings in the water levels of Lake Michigan and the Chicago River, wreaking havoc on the city and prompting urgent action to find a fix. In the winter of 2020, the water level in Lake Michigan hit a record high and intense rains just kept coming. Waves crashed over Lakeshore Drive, sending water up to the third floor of some buildings. The Chicago River also began to overflow into downtown. The balance between the river and the lake has always been delicate, ever since the city dug canals over a century ago to keep waste from flowing from the river into the lake, which supplies the city's drinking water. A backup system for flooding was also created: locks that reverse the river back into the lake when the river gets too high. Last year's rainfall, however, was so severe that for the first time that backup system didn't work. The lake was higher than the river level, so water could not be reversed. Lockmasters had to wait until the river rose above the lake before they could start the reversal process. That delay was destructive. Downtown Chicago suffered massive flooding, even knocking out power at the Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower. Experts say this was not a once-in-a-lifetime event, but a sign of what is to come, as climate change causes heavier rains and more intense storms. \"The biggest risk is that these changes in the climate, in hydrology, or the water levels are going to exceed the infrastructure or the capacity of cities, coastlines and homes to handle those changes,\" said Drew Gronewold, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School for Environment and Sustainability. Gronewold said Chicago and other cities around the Great Lakes are all in danger of not being able to handle these extreme highs -- and extreme lows. Just seven years before that storm, the water in Lake Michigan hit a record low due to a prolonged drought. That threatened the city's water supply as well as shipping, critical to the economy of the Midwest. \"When water levels go down, they have to do what's called light load. They have to reduce the amount of cargo they can carry, and they effectively lose millions if not billions of dollars,\" said Gronewold. After the 2020 flooding, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers installed large concrete barriers along parts of Lake Michigan that border downtown. This was necessary even after the corps began reinforcing Chicago's shoreline in a half-billion-dollar project that started 20 years ago. Now it is launching a new multiyear effort funded by the EPA to evaluate future conditions, factoring in climate change. \"We're trying to forecast what those conditions will be in the future so that we can plan for those conditions and create resilient designs,\" said David Bucaro, chief of the project management section with the Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District. Those could include structural or natural features. The city is now working to plant tens of thousands of trees that can also help to capture the rain where it falls and keep it from all flowing into the river. Chicago's Metropolitan Planning Council has been pushing the city to reduce its carbon footprint, because the only real fix locally is to limit warming globally. \"A lot of people look at the Midwest like it's a safe bet for the future of climate change, but if we're having this problem, it's maybe just not as safe a bet as people have been thinking,\" said Justin Keller, manager at the Metropolitan Planning Council. \"The city and the Army Corps are hoping for more funding from the trillion-dollar infrastructure bill still making its way through Congress. Infrastructure designs of the past will no longer do, and while new research on rainfall and drought around the Great Lakes is certainly helpful, engineers need funding to implement all that learning into a critical fix.\" \"I would argue that the economy of the Midwest depends entirely on water,\" said Gronewold. \"We really need to be paying more attention to the future of this area and, in particular, how we're going to improve the infrastructure to handle these changes.\" "

        "header": "These companies are sucking carbon out of the atmosphere \u2014 and investors are piling in",
        "content": "The race to reduce carbon emissions is heating up, much like the planet itself is. But reducing emissions alone will not be enough to stop what's happening. It is not even enough to reach the goal of the Paris climate agreement, which is to limit global in this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. There is, however, a technology that's being touted as a way to get us there faster  vacuuming carbon from the atmosphere  and major investors are now piling in. Just outside Zurich, more than a dozen massive fans are fast at work, cleaning the air of carbon dioxide. So-called direct air capture is the leading edge of what could become the largest environmental industry aimed at saving the planet. The company behind it, Climeworks, is one of the few offering the technology to basically vacuum the atmosphere of carbon. The plant in Switzerland removes about 900 tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to Climeworks policy chief Chris Beuttler. To put it in perspective, globally we are emitting 40 billion tons. Beuttler calls the plant a \"drop in the bucket,\" but the bucket is getting bigger fast, as new companies like Climeworks, as well as governments, seek to monumentally expand what is called direct carbon capture. \"This has to reach several gigatons in terms of scale and not just technologies like direct air capture, but all carbon removal solutions combined. We need everything,\" said Beuttler. Canada-based Carbon Engineering has been working on direct air capture since 2015. Arizona State University and Silicon Kingdom Holdings are deploying proprietary carbon-capture technology that acts like a tree. \"[It's] thousands of times more efficient at removing CO2from the air,\" ASU's website says. \"The 'mechanical trees' allow the captured gas to be sequestered or sold for re-use.\" Climeworks' system is a box with a huge fan on one end and a filter inside that attracts only carbon dioxide. The fan pulls the air through the filter, and once the filter is saturated, the box is closed. It is then heated to 100 degrees Celsius, and the pure carbon dioxide is released and collected. The captured carbon can either be buried deep underground or sold for other uses. Climeworks installed the Zurich system in 2017, and by 2020 had raised $100 million from the likes of Microsoft, Audi, Shopify and Stripe. It is now building a much larger plant in Iceland. \"It has to become a trillion-dollar market. And I think those are the kinds of investors that see that there's a long-term return on this,\" said Beuttler. He likens it to the fast rise of electric vehicles, solar panels and wind farms. Now the state of California is working on plans to use carbon capture to reach its aggressive goal of carbon neutrality. \"We have to try to proceed. There's no choice. We have to sequester carbon at a high rate,\" said Ken Alex, director of Project Climate at the Center for Law, Energy and Environment at the University of California, Berkeley. Carbon-capture technology has been around for a while, he noted, but was considered too expensive. \"The price has already come down dramatically, and as it scales up, I think it's not unrealistic to think that this is a viable opportunity,\" he said. Alex estimates that the world needs about 50,000 carbon-capture plants by 2050, which would cost about $10 trillion. It is unquestionably a colossal investment, but with ample potential returns  beyond of course saving the planet. The captured carbon dioxide can be used to make fuel, plastics, even bubbles. Climeworks sells some of its captured carbon to  Coca-Cola . Ironically, oil producers like  Exxon  and  Chevron  are investing heavily in carbon capture because the carbon can be used to release trapped oil underground. \"Those opportunities are part of the investment dynamic,\" said Alex. \"It's a new industry and it's just getting its feet wet, but I think the possibilities are quite substantial.\" Carbon removal also offers a new opportunity for the carbon credit market. Right now, companies can get credits for avoided emissions, or lower emissions, but in a net-zero world, they have to not just lower but remove carbon. Now, they can buy those credits from removal companies like Climeworks. That's why big names like  Microsoft , which has said it wants to remove its emissions by 2030, are buying into this. \"In order to stick within the safe levels of global warming, we have to expand this,\" Beuttler said. \"This is not a question of can we? It's a question of we have to.\""

        "content": "Miami's Hard Rock Stadium will host about 65,000 fans on Super Bowl Sunday. While the biggest battle in football will last just one evening, the fight that stadium faces from the effects of climate change will go on indefinitely. It is not alone. Teams and stadiums across country are dealing with flooding, extreme storms, excessive heat and smoke from wildfires. \"The last three years in September, we've had climate issues, whether they're hurricane threats. We had to actually move a game,\" said Tom Garfinkel, CEO of the Miami Dolphins football team. \"We've had lightning strikes that we've never had in 30 years here, where we had to delay a game. It was the longest game in the history of the NFL.\" The Dolphins paid $500 million to renovate the open-air stadium, just in time for Hurricane Irma in 2017. Then in 2018, a random rainfall caused the field to flood during a college game at the stadium. And that's just one stadium. In Florida, the sports industry contributes $57.4 billion and 580,000 jobs to the state economy annually, according to a 2017 survey by the Florida Sports Foundation. It is home to 10 professional sports teams, 26 minor league teams and 60 college sports programs. American Airlines Arena, where the Miami Heat basketball franchise plays, sits right on the edge of Miami's Biscayne Bay. \"The Arena will begin to flood with only two feet of sea level rise. I'm talking 20 years or less,\" said Henry Briceno, a professor at Florida International University who studies the impact of climate change on water. He expects a similar fate for the Hard Rock Stadium at a three feet rise, and said he was appalled to hear that a Major League Soccer expansion team, backed by soccer icon David Beckham, is proposing a new stadium be built near the Miami airport. \"I don't know if those guys know that they are building in the future Atlantis,\" said Briceno. The risks extend far beyond Florida. In San Diego, the Padres' Petco Park flooded in 2017, while Western Michigan University's football stadium was overwhelmed last June, when record rainfall turned it into a massive swimming pool. At Davenport, Iowa's minor league stadium  Modern Woodmen Park  overflowing rivers last May turned it from a field of dreams into an island. \"Every community that hosts a professional sports venue, a sports stadium or arena, is going to be affected by global climate disruption, by climate change, whether through storm surges, more precipitation, stronger hurricanes, wildfires, droughts,\" said Allen Hershkowitz, environmental science advisor to the New York Yankees, the first and only such known position in professional sports. Hershkowitz also advises Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, the U.S. Tennis Association and Major League Soccer. Formerly at the National Resources Defense Council, he worked with former Major League Baseball C o mmissioner Bud Selig to create the Commissioner's Initiative on Sustainable Ballpark Operations in 2005. The program promoted responsible environmental stewardship for MLB, helping teams reduce their carbon footprints in ballparks. This was then followed by every other professional sports league in the U.S. and others around the world. \"What Commissioner Selig and Major League Baseball recognized years ago is that environmental constraints, economic constraints cause by environmental issues, are going to increasingly affect the economics and the operations of sporting events,\" said Hershkowitz. \"We're dealing with very large real estate infrastructure investments. Regardless of who owns them, they are going to be affected.\" As a result, the sports industry is actually one of the most aggressive in going green and that sends a powerful message because, while very few people follow climate science, the vast majority of Americans follow sports. \"I mean, no one looks at the New York Yankees and thinks that they're some kind of a left-wing radical organization,\" added Hershkowitz. The Yankees, among others, are investing in carbon compensation projects, and most teams are now reducing their carbon footprints in their stadiums. This year the Dolphins are eliminating all single-use plastics. Cups will now be aluminum. The initiative is especially imperative to the Dolphins' owner, Stephen Ross, who is also chairman of The Related Cos., the developer behind Manhattan's massive new Hudson Yards project, a retail, office and residential complex which sits on the edge of the Hudson River. \"There's risk for everything. It's not just sports,\" said Ross. \"That's why I'm very active now in dealing with the climate, being upfront and doing things. You can't wait to say, 'Oh my God,' and do it too late. If we don't do something now, we are looking at extinction.\" Ross said he sees growing risks to his investments in both real estate and in the Dolphins. He also said he believes sports can be a great unifier in overcoming the brutal politics surrounding climate change. \"When sports can pick something up, you're really hitting and talking to an audience that's very broad. If it impacts sports, it really just makes it that much more important,\" said Ross."

        "header": "Off-the-grid homes are coming to your neighborhood, as climate change creates suburban survivalists",
        "content": "The Atlantic hurricane season doesn't official begin until June 1, but excessive spring flooding has already displaced thousands of residents in Louisiana.  A freak ice storm in Texas in February took out much of the state's power grid, plunging nearly 10 million people into a cold, dark catastrophe. More than 150 people died, and at an estimated $200 billion, it was the costliest natural disaster in the state's history. And California's last wildfire season set the record for the largest amount of land burned in modern history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The fires destroyed over 10,000 structures   and cost over $10 billion in property damage. The growing effects of climate change are no longer seasonal .  Increasingly extreme weather from climate change is now a year-round phenomenon. This has homebuilders reconsidering how they design and power new homes, and how to take them off the grid, so they can be more environmentally sustainable, as well as operational when disaster hits. It also has traditional homebuyers thinking more like survivalists. \"More severe storms each year are going to further and further indicate the needs for resilient development,\" said Ben Keys, associate professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Keys studies the effects of climate change on real estate and the growing need for housing that can function off the grid. This goes well beyond solar panels. \"These houses can be built in much more efficient ways, so not just solar, but they can have their own water filters, other sources of electricity generation and a number of other efficient ways to manage their utilities,\" said Keys. A growing number of small builders, like California-based Dvele, are stepping up to the challenge. \"The whole idea of the self-powered home actually came from the California wildfires where the grids were shutting down,\" said Matt Howland, Dvele's president. Dvele, founded in 2017, builds its homes in a factory. They are sleek, modern designs with high-end fixtures and finishings. The average size is about 2,600 square feet, although it can be larger, and the cost is around $1.2 million. That is about 20% higher than the cost of a comparably sized luxury home with none of the resilient efficiencies and technologies. Dvele homes have solar, battery and other construction and insulation elements, as well as smart technology, that allow them to use far less energy and operate longer off the grid. The home monitors its own energy input and output all the time, then tweaks the systems to save more. If the local power goes out, the home should see no difference. \"We're seeing things that we've never seen before and that grids simply aren't made to manage. Since all the events in Texas, the interest in the self-powered concept has really gone off the charts for us,\" said Howland. Most of Dvele's projects are on the West Coast, but they are forecastingbig expansion of individual homes and whole new communities in other states. The highest-risk homes are in California, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, along the Mississippi River, and large Gulf and Atlantic coastal stretches, according to CoreLogic's annual Catastrophe Report. Major grid failure or \"blackout\" events in the U.S., impacting 50,000 or more people, jumped by more than 60% since 2015, according to new research published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Homeowners have become much more aware of their risk and much more inclined to do something about it. There is more interest now than ever before from consumers seeking new strategies to safeguard themselves and their families from climate events. Rise, a home improvement website dedicated specifically to sustainable projects, has seen a sharp increase in off-the-grid queries from its followers. \"It's homeowner independence in general. A new way of thinking where you're not relying on others and realizing there are a lot of things they can do,\" said Rise CEO Matthew Daigle. \"Solar is just a piece of the pie. They're taking a page from rural settings.\" They may be taking a page, but this isn't about individuals living in a cabin in the woods, away from society, as off-the-grid has long been considered. \"It's not just for extremists. I think you're going to see more and more people looking for ways in which they can protect themselves as there are increased risk from storms, more utility disruptions, and more need for resiliency,\" said Wharton's Keys. Growth in off-the-grid technology is not just expected for individual homes. Dvele is now exploring shared storage on microgrids for whole communities of its homes. \"We didn't anticipate it would go this fast nationally, but we're excited for the growth,\" said Howland. The biggest hurdle to more expansion of off-the-grid housing is cost. Right now it is expensive, and especially so to retrofit homes. Most of the demand is coming from wealthier homeowners and homebuyers. \"I think the funding is a big challenge because the payoffs to many of these investments don't pay off right away,\" said Keys. Incremental changes at the high end can filter down, which happens a lot with technology that is in our appliances and in our heating and cooling systems today. The more investment in off-the-grid technology, the cheaper it will become. \"So you need investors, or you need homeowners who have that long view and recognize that these benefits are going to accrue over time,\" Keys added."

        "content": "With storms intensifying, rainfall increasing and sea levels rising, waterfront property owners have to get more creative.For some, that means moving to higher ground, but for others, it's just moving the house higher. House lifting has long been a strategy for waterfront real estate, but it is now becoming a far bigger business due to climate change. \"The more that things flood, the more there's going to be a need for it,\" said Mike Brovont of Wolfe House and Building Movers. He's been in the house-lifting business for more than two decades. Brovont points to flooding hot spots like Houston, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. \"Of course, New Jersey and Connecticut shoreline are always susceptible to that as well,\" he added. \"And then you get those high tides, what they call king tides in some areas. You get that combined with a storm coming in, and that can just do tremendous damage.\" New Jersey tops the list of states with the most homes that are expected to see at least one major flood per year by 2050, based on projected sea-level rise. Some 74,165 homes in the state will be affected, according to Climate Central. Next are Florida (57,865), California (36,845), Louisiana (33,372) and North Carolina (33,334). Santo Siciliano and his wifeadore living by the water. \"I grew up on the shore. So for me, it's a no-brainer,\" he said. The flood risk to their Oceanport, New Jersey, home is increasing, however, so to stay in their home, they had to lift it. \"It's just something that unfortunately we're faced with,\" he said. \"You know, whether it's climate change or anything else.\" The Sicilianos lifted their home to comply with new local flood zone building codes. Their home is now one of several houses on the street that was lifted. \"It's fairly safe. It's down to an art,\" said Wolfe's Ryan Hess, the foreman on the Sicilianos' project. Hess said he has lifted all kinds of homes, from bungalows to 7,000-square-foot mansions. \"We've had a lot of work from Hurricane Sandy,\" Hess said. The superstorm slammed the Northeast Coast  in 2012, causing widespread catastrophic destruction along the Jersey Shore, Long Island and New York City. And as storms increase in frequency and intensity, it's likely this kind of devastation will continue. There were 22 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters across the U.S. in 2020, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That crushes the previous annual record of 16 events, which occurred in 2017 and 2011. The 22 events cost the nation a combined $95 billion in damages. The U.S. saw a record 30 named hurricanes last year, and 12 made landfall, also a record. As the water rises, so too must the real estate. House lifting can cost anywhere from $10,000 for a small home to more than $1 million for a large, historic building. While the danger from rising water is high, the risk of lifting the house is actually not. Experts in the field say it is a precise, gentle, almost delicate practice that happens very slowly and carefully. In some cases, homeowners can leave their furniture inside the homes. \"There's always risk but over the years, we've definitely come up with ways to mitigate that risk quite a bit,\" said Brovont. \"Now, really, most houses can be lifted without any expectation of damage. A lot of times we can even lift them without any cracks in the drywall.\" Companies like his carry special insurance, of course  a cargo or a rigger's insurance that specifically covers the house for damage caused by the house mover. For some, the flood risk is all part of the waterfront reward, and so they try to rise above it. \"We're shore people,\" said Siciliano. \"You know, something about not being able to get to the beach in less than 10 minutes ... it's not something I want to do.\""

        "header": "Wildfires are putting water supplies at risk, and corporate America is scared",
        "content": "As wildfires tear across America's West, the immediate risk is to life and property, but they will eventually affect water supplies. That's one reason large corporations are beginning to help fund forest restoration in order to mitigate their water risk. The water supply for many communities, including large cities, starts in mountains and national forests. In California, about 70% of the water either starts or flows through national forests, according to Forest Service estimates. \"When we have large-scale fires like this, we get huge amounts of erosion that end up filling up the dams and reservoirs that store water and that help create hydropower,\" said Eli Ilano, forest supervisor for the Tahoe National Forest. \"That is why there is a huge sense of urgency to do work in the forests, thin and restore them, in order to make them more resilient to climate change and to these large-scale, catastrophic fires.\" After large-scale forest fires, mudslides often follow, filling reservoirs, contaminating their water and reducing their capacity. Cleaning the reservoirs is costly and time consuming. And it's not just the mud. Trees also help retain the water in the mountains and then slowly release it so that dams and reservoirs don't have to face a sudden influx of water. Companies are now coming around to the idea that they need to help fund forest preservation to protect water supplies that are essential to their business. \"Corporations in all sorts of different sectors, in the beverage sector, agricultural sector, tech sector, they're all taking this quite seriously and looking at how they can be part of the solution,\" said Todd Gartner, director of Cities4Forests and WRI's Natural Infrastructure Initiative. In the technology sector, for instance, many data centers, which need water to cool the banks of computers running inside, are in water-stressed areas. For other product manufacturers, water is crucial to every aspect of the process. \"Water is essential to our business. We need it to manufacture our products, and we need it to use our products in homes,\" said Shannon Quinn, global water stewardship leader for  Procter & Gamble . In just the last year, Procter & Gamble provided a $200,000 grant to restore 400 acres in the Eldorado National Forest, which feeds the water supply of Sacramento and San Francisco Bay Area cities. \"Business has a responsibility to address these issues. And for water specifically, I think it's really a matter of identifying those areas where your business may be at risk,\" said Quinn. Two years ago, the nonprofit  Blue Forest Conservation  organization launched the first ever  Forest Resilience Bond  at $4 million. \"It is really a public/private partnership where we've engaged investors like pension plans, insurance companies ... even impact investors like foundations, to help cover the upfront costs of doing this much-needed forest restoration work with the primary goal of reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire,\" Blue Forest founder Zach Knight said at the time. Private capital was used to thin and restore about 15,000 acres in the Tahoe National Forest. Investors are being paid back by local water and hydroelectric utilities. Now, working with the World Resources Institute, Blue Forest is about to launch its second Forest Resilience Bond, aimed at 48,000 acres of forest restoration. The $25 million value is more than six times the first issuance, and investor interest is so strong that there is already about $200 million more in the pipeline for additional bonds, according to Knight. The return on the Forest Resilience Bond is only about 4%, but investors are more interested in lowering their risk from costly droughts and disruptions to their water supply. While most of the investors initially are foundations and pension funds, Gartner says large corporations are now at the table, planning to invest in the next offerings. He said he could not name them.  \"They are increasingly interested in how this fits into their water targets, into their community benefit goals, and how they can leverage the investments of the government, of utilities, and even other businesses to get this work done at scale and to take advantage of the leverage of multiple actors working for large scale impact,\" he said. The Eldorado National Forest is being affected by the  Caldor Fire , which has burned more than 200,000 acres and is threatening the resort town of South Lake Tahoe in California. The state has  closed all national forests  to public access through at least Sept. 17 to reduce fire risks and ensure the safety of firefighters."

        "header": "Former subprime player claims he can now short the mortgage market for climate and Covid risks",
        "content": "During the mortgage bubble in the early 2000s, when investors were feverishly trading faulty subprime bonds, a few savvy skeptics recognized the bonds were doomed, so theybet against them. They shorted the bonds and made billions. Now one of those players is doing the same thing, but not on subprime. He's doing it based on the risks to the housing market from climate change and  the coronavirus pandemic . Dave Burt is a financial analyst who looks at risk in real estate derivatives markets. That's what he was doing back in 2005, analyzing vast pools of subprime mortgage bonds that Wall Street was creating and trading. He examined the homes and borrowers who owned them. \"I had a strong suspicion that they would go bad,\" said Burt. Burt sold his findings to the few investors who wanted to short those pools of mortgages. They were right and made billions. He was featured in Michael Lewis' best-selling book \"The Big Short.\" \"Burt had the most sensational information and models to analyze the information,\" Lewis wrote. \"He could tell you, for example, what would happen to mortgage loans zip code by zip code in various house price scenarios.\" Burt now says he can do the same thing when it comes to climate risk. Burt says that as the risks of floods, fires and wind increase, the cost of owning a home will go up  costs from higher insurance rates, higher taxes and uninsured losses. As the cost goes up, the value of the home goes down, and, consequently, the mortgage on the home is at higher risk of default. It is just like during the subprime storm, when borrowers who couldn't really afford the homes they were buying were offered loans that were cheap up front but then quickly turned expensive. They then defaulted on those loans, and home values crashed, bringing the broader economy down with them. \"This is going to be much more broadly impactful than just a mortgage story,\" said Burt, who is using data from Boston-based risQ, a data analytics firm specializing in climate risk. He's looking at specific areas where home values are likely to fall from climate impacts, causing homeowners to walk away from their mortgage. In order to profit off that information, he's going to short a specific type of mortgage bond. \"These bonds are issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to essentially protect them against the first X number of losses,\" he explained. Burt thinks those bonds are overvalued because, by his calculations, close to a third of U.S. homeowners are vulnerable to big losses in the value of their homes from climate change. \"I think it's quite viable and indeed as an economic proposition but also as a political proposition,\" said Jesse Keenan, associate professor of real estate at Tulane University and a climate expert. Keenan said he believes that in a Biden administration, more focused on climate overall, and with the potential for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to come out of government conservatorship, investors will be looking even more closely at these credit risk transfers. \"It shows now there is a market for credit risk transfers. You have a market, a buyer, a seller, an underwriter. I think it's all there,\" said Keenan. Burt is essentially profiting off of people's peril. He admits that, with one caveat. \"Honestly, I'm doing this in large part less for the profits and more to make a difference. The subprime mortgage problem, if people had become aware, through realization of market losses, of the problems being created by subprime risk in 2005, 2 million households wouldn't have had to go through foreclosure,\" he said. Burt says he will take half the profits generated by his investments and put them into a nonprofit that will, in turn, invest in clean energy technology, carbon capture technology and social response efforts to the effects of climate change. More importantly, he claims he is educating the financial market about climate risk, even as he takes a risk himself. \"The biggest risk to this approach is timing. How long can I pay for those shorts before this theme gets realized?\" In other words, before the the devastating impacts of climate change create massive dislocation. Burt recently launched his own investment firm, Delta Terra Capita, which bills itself as \"climate risk intelligence for institutional investors.\" Its platform offers tools to measure the physical risk of real estate losses and then translate that into the financial impacts on real estate investments, mortgage securities and related derivatives. Now Burt is adding the coronavirus to the mix because he believes climate and Covid together make the bet even bigger. \"Covid has created a lot of problems fundamentally for the systems that support the housing market and have potentially been contributing to the mispricing of these climate risks and asset values. Namely, that insurance premiums are too low,\" said Burt. About 3 million mortgages are now in government or private sector Covid bailout programs, and there isno guarantee that those borrowers will ever get current on their loans again, so the homes are at risk of foreclosure. \"You're talking about very high delinquency rates of mortgages that we all thought were much higher quality than, for instance, you saw before the crisis,\" explained Burt. Rising foreclosures cause surrounding home values to fall. Home prices right now are inflating fast because of huge demand from Covid's stay-at-home culture. \"It's really the conflated impact of climate risks being rationalized in valuations and the current state of the economy, as a result of the Covid impacts, that will create these substantial value declines,\" he added."

        "header": "Every American home is getting a flood-risk score \u2013 and many are at higher risk than previously known",
        "content": "As Hurricane Laura bears down on the Gulf Coast, residents are preparing for what could be a historic storm surge. The potential for widespread flooding is high, but even after major storms like Hurricane Harvey in 2017, some homeowners in high-risk areas still do not have flood insurance. That's because today's federal flood maps, which guide insurance demand, are backward-looking and don't factor in the effects of climate change. Starting this week, however, every homeowner and potential homebuyer in America will be able to see a new, forward-looking analysis of their property's flood risk. That could have a huge impact on the national housing market. A nonprofit research and technology group, First Street Foundation launched an  interactive website  offering flood risk data on more than 142 million homes and properties across the country in June. Now Realtor.com, one of the nation's largest home listing sites, will put those scores on all of its listings. First Street, working with more than 80 scientists and researchers, is remapping America's flood risk in an effort to educate homeowners, buyers and the greater real estate industry. It assigns a flood score to every property. \"We're basically building flood models that calculate the past, present and future flood risk for every home in the country,\" said Matthew Eby, founder and executive director of the First Street Foundation. \"By integrating Flood Factor into Realtor.com's platform, we will not only reach millions of people on a daily basis, we will do so when they need it most when they are buying or selling a home.\" When Hurricane Harvey inundated the Houston area three years ago, most of the homes damaged or destroyed had no flood insurance because they were not in FEMA-designated flood zones, according to the National Flood Insurance Program. FEMA flood maps are often outdated, not comprehensive and don't factor in the effects of climate change. While FEMA classifies nearly 9 million U.S. properties as having substantial risk, requiring them to carry federal flood insurance, First Street identifies nearly 70% more, or more than 14.5 million properties, with the same level of risk. It calculated that more than half the properties in Harvey's path were at high flood risk and should have had insurance. The difference is that First Street uses current and projected climate data, including sea-level rise. It also maps actual rainfall, which is increasing dramatically, and includes areas FEMA hasn't mapped. It then assigns each property a flood score ranging from lowest risk of 1 to highest of 10. \"I think there's a great partnership to be had where we can create awareness of flood risk and how it's likely to change, and that will incentivize people to then ask FEMA for help within the National Flood Insurance Program and then create insurance policies that are affordable to protect themselves,\" said Eby. First Street is backed by various foundations. While it offers its data free to the public on its site, it is also selling bulk data on millions of properties to mortgage companies, insurers, commercial real estate brokers and appraisers  and to Realtor.com, which will now include flood risk on every property on its site. \"Anything that's going to affect the value of that home needs to be considered,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. Hale admits the new flood scores may lower the value of certain homes. The higher the flood risk is, the more it costs to insure the home, which then detracts from its value. Homes with higher flood risk may also not sell as quickly as others with lower risk in nearby areas. \"Putting information about what the flood risk is today, and how it might change over the future in response to climate change, arms consumers with information they can use to make really good decisions for themselves, and think about not just what's happening today but also what the world might look like in the future for their biggest asset, which is their home,\" added Hale. Commercial real estate entities are also hungry for the newest research on flood risk. This is why LightBox, a commercial real estate software and analytics company, is now partnering with First Street. LightBox's clients include lending institutions, commercial real estate appraisal companies and brokerage firms, insurance companies and asset owners. \"Given the universe of commercial properties in the United States, for example, we can take that data, overlay it and find which properties intersect with different flood forecasts, and then we can basically deliver that information to our customers,\" said Zach Wade, vice president of data science at LightBox. Wade noted that because First Street is nonprofit, its methodology is extremely transparent, unlike other climate data companies. He can look at all the research coming in from any of the academics or research models involved in the flood scores. \"I think each of our customer segments will increasingly consume this type of flood information, and it'll become a necessary component of their essential due diligence process,\" he added. First Street is also embarking on new projects to map fire and drought risk on residential and commercial properties. This comes as historic fires are raging across California and parts of Colorado. While other companies are mapping risk, they're not offering it to the public for free at such a granular level. This new information is likely to change a lot of factors for homeowners, from mortgages to insurance to the very value of their homes. CNBC's  Erica Posse  produced the video for this article."

        "header": "There's a new way for investors to turn a profit while helping California prevent fires",
        "content": "As wildfires rage through western California, a new way to help prevent them is now being tested in nearby Tahoe National Forest. It is a first-of-its-kind financial tool, designed to help investors fund forest restoration in overgrown, highly combustible areas, which are becoming ever more dangerous due to climate change. The Forest Resilience Bond was developed by the nonprofit investment firm Blue Forest Conservation, a Sacramento, California-based start-up, in partnership with World Resources Institute. It seeks to lower the risk of dangerous and destructive wildfires by shifting the heavy costs of forest restoration from the state's forest service to private investors. \"It is really a public/private partnership where we've engaged investors like pension plans, insurance companies, even impact investors like foundations, to help cover the upfront costs of doing this much-needed forest restoration work, with the primary goal of reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire,\" said Zach Knight, co-founder and managing partner of Blue Forest. The bond deal was finalized late last year, and forest thinning work has been underway in more than 15,000 acres of forestland in the North Yuba River watershed for several months. The restoration should not only reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, but also protect water resources, avoid carbon emissions and even create rural jobs. Here's how it works: Investors buy into the bond, and the money is drawn as needed for forest restoration work. This includes thinning, strategic backfires and other rehabilitation. In this first case, it was a $4 million bond with money from CSAA Insurance, Maryland-based investment firm Calvert Impact Capital, The Rockefeller Foundation, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. \"There is overwhelming need for cost-effective climate solutions to help communities dealing with the dual threats of mega-fires and droughts,\" said Saadia Madsbjerg, managing director at The Rockefeller Foundation, in a release. The investors are paid back over five years, with 4% interest, by those who benefit from the work and have contracted with Blue Forest, like the U.S. Forest Service and state agencies. In this case, payments will come from the Yuba Water Agency, whose reservoirs receive water from the forest and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"There are about 300,000 acres upstream of our reservoir here that our water comes from, and we care about the quality and quantity of that water from the forest,\" said Willie Whittlesey, assistant general manager at the Yuba Water Agency. \"The need for funds is immediate. We have the effects of climate change, and we have a longer summer season, or a shorter wet season. We have significant north winds that are an effect of climate change. We need to do something now.\" Yuba is putting $1.5 million into the bond because the forest work can actually help it save money. A healthier forest will result in less sediment and debris running into the reservoirs. Yuba Water spends millions of dollars cleaning its reservoirs of that debris, and those costs have been rising recently. Yuba can no longer rely on funds directly from the U.S. Forest Service, because the Forest Service is now spending more than half its budget fighting fires. Last year was the deadliest and  most destructive fire season in California history . More than 8,500 fires burned nearly 2 million acres, according to CalFire, and insurance claims surpassed $12 billion. Twenty-five years ago the forest service spent just 15% of its budget on firefighting. \"It creates this vicious cycle where we're spending all this money to fight fires, and that takes money away from the preventative work that could stop those fires in the first place,\" said Knight. \"I think it really is the overgrowth of the forest which had to do with some of the management activities, combined with that increasingly hotter and dryer climate that's creating the fire conditions today.\" The effects of climate change will push the cost of firefighting even higher, as warmer temperatures and dryer weather cause more flare-ups. 2017 was also one of the worst on record for wildfires in California, and it was also the second-hottest year on record for the state, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As the current California fires push the issue back into the headlines, calls for forest restoration are getting louder. \"We need to invest more in forest management,\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said in an interview Tuesday on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\" \"We did not have the prescribed fires that were necessary. We did not have the brush clearing that was necessary. This has been a decades-of-neglect process that has led to this crisis.\" And the bond couldn't come at a better time in the investor community, as an increasingly popular trend of socially conscious investing is taking off. It's called ESG, which stands for environmental, social and corporate governance. It focuses on investing for the greater good; in this case, buying into the health of the forest but still making money. It is exactly the kind of investment Jennifer Pryce, CEO of Calvert Impact Capital, says her clients want. \"Our investors are looking for an impact and a financial return, and this is off the charts when you look at what it's giving back,\" said Pryce, who polls investors each year to see how they want to align their capital with their values. \"Fighting climate change is No. 1.\" She admits this one was a difficult sell because it is designed to prevent fires, rather than fight them. Still, once the possibilities and savings were made clear, the investors were in. \"It was interesting because it was a first of a kind,\" said Pryce. \"Because of that we felt like we wanted to understand what was being envisioned as a solution to what is a huge problem, but we also saw it could be replicated.\" And that was an integral part of Blue Forest's plan from the start, to create an investment vehicle that could help all kinds of projects to protect public land and real estate from the effects of climate change. \"This was really the first private investment that supports the management of our public lands,\" said Knight. \"And we were well oversubscribed from investors for this first project. Luckily, now we can put a few more of them together and help the Forest Service achieve more of their goals.\" The next project, which will launch in the second quarter of 2020, will likely be $6 million to $8 million in financing, according to Knight. \"But the need from the Forest Service is in the tens of billions of dollars, so we've been really intentional making sure it works, changing what we need to for the next project, making sure the next one works, and really building up a program,\" he added. The larger the bonds get, the cheaper it will be for those downstream beneficiaries, like Yuba Water, because more agencies like them will be paying investors back. Knight is hoping to add others like farms, breweries or power companies to future bond projects. The more bonds they can do, the faster the work can get done. That is not lost on investors. \"If this transaction isn't replicated, or there aren't other funds allocated to do the forest clearing, the forest fires can still rage, and this will be an island within a large ocean of challenge,\" said Pryce."

        "content": "GOVERNORS ISLAND, N.Y.  They are salty, sumptuous and often served opulently on ice. They are also now on the front lines in the fight to protect coastal real estate from climate change. Oysters  more precisely, oyster reefs. Oyster reefs are hard, natural barriers that protect shorelines from erosion, rising tides and increasingly severe storm surge. They knock down the height and force of waves, but they've been decimated by a century of overharvesting and worsening water quality. Now, they are being restored and repopulated by multiple projects using millions of dollars of public and private funding. \"We've seen a loss of almost 80% of oysters in estuaries worldwide,\" said Antonio Rodriguez, a University of North Carolina professor of marine sciences who studies oyster reef growth. He says the best way to protect the billions of dollars' worth of coastal real estate from increasingly severe storm surge and rising sea levels is to go back to nature. \"The goal is to keep people safe, keep their property intact,\" he said. \"And sometimes making your environment more natural, and learning from the way the environment was before we developed it, those are the best techniques.\" Sea water is becoming more acidic due to the absorption of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. About 30% of human-made CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, according to scientists at the University of California, Davis. Ocean acidification makes it harder for shellfish, including oysters, to build their shells and reproduce. Oysters actually help clean the water. So a massive move is on to repopulate the oyster reefs in projects by states, local municipalities, universities, the Navy and Air Force. The Billion Oyster Project is one of the most ambitious  a table-to-farm strategy backed by nearly $4 million in state and federal funding from the 2012 Superstorm Sandy. It collects 10,000 pounds of discarded restaurant shells per week, brings them to Governor's Island to cure for a year, then puts them into a hatchery where they spawn oyster larvae that mix with the shells. Depending on its size, one old shell can become a new home to up to 20 new oysters. \"Once Sandy happened and the aftermath of that, we realized really just how valuable oyster reefs in New York Harbor could be,\" said Madeline Wachtel, deputy director of the project. \"New York Harbor used to have over 200,000 acres of oyster reefs protecting the shoreline. And that population is virtually extinct.\" The project operates out of the New York Harbor School, a public high school based on the island. Students divide thousands and thousands of shells into small, permeable bags, which then go into large, bath-tub like tanks for several weeks. Once they've grown, they are strategically placed in the harbor. The goal is to put 1 billion live oysters across 100 acres of reefs by 2035  bag by bag. \"We want to grow the next generation of stewards who are going to know how to steward their local environment,\" said Wachtel. They are not the only volunteers in the project. More than 70 New York City area restaurants are donating their wholly eaten half shells to Billion Oyster, collecting them in trash bins and loading them onto trucks weekly. At Manhattans' iconic Gramercy Tavern, where the menu celebrates locally sourced, sustainable food, Chef Michael Anthony was fascinated by the idea. \"When I learned a little bit more about their technique for compressing them in cages and reintroducing spat, baby oysters, and dropping them back into New York Harbor, they had me hooked,\" said Anthony. \"We're lucky to live and work in New York City where we have access to some of the freshest and the best, the widest variety, of species anywhere in the world. But with that comes a responsibility of the choices that we make.\" Projects are underway up and down the East Coast as well as in parts of California and Washington state. Permitting can often be tricky, and poachers are a danger to fledgling new reefs, but the investments are growing. In Louisiana, where oysters are big business, local and state government and nongovernmental organizations have invested more than $70 million in constructing oyster reefs for shoreline protection benefits. \"Louisiana's 2012 Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast (CPRA 2012) includes constructed oyster reefs as a coastal restoration technique, which may also benefit the oyster resource,\" according to a paper by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Last spring, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., introduced legislation to protect coastal communities from the effects of climate change. The Living Shorelines Act would \"create a federal grant program through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assist states, localities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in constructing living shorelines,\" according to a release. The legislation provides $50 million in federal funds that would be matched by state and local governments and NGOs applying for grants and projects. After Superstorm Sandy, the Department of Housing and Urban Development launched a funding project called Rebuild by Design. Winning proposals would get federal funding as well as funding from New York state. The Living Breakwaters Project, of which Billion Oyster is a part, was one of the winners. It showed that it was not only making the coastline more resilient and enhancing the ecology, but it was promoting social resilience, that is, building a community around education on coastal resiliency. \"We want to engage communities everywhere,\" said Wachtel. \"Because that's actually how you get longstanding change, right? If the community and the people that live there and work there are actively involved.\"  CNBC's  Erica Posse  contributed as a video producer."

Residents were fed up with increasingly intense and frequent flooding, so they are moving to higher ground. Together. The residents of Pecan Acres are some of America's first climate refugees. The plan to move them could become a blueprint for other towns, as increasingly extreme weather and rising sea levels force more and more residents from the homes they've known for decades. Pecan Acres, a subdivision of New Roads, Louisiana, was built in the 1970s along a canal. While it was always prone to flooding, in the last decade the floods have gotten much worse and much more destructive. The area levee is no longer adequate to hold the heavier rainfall. Back-to-back floods in 2016 and 2017 drew the governor's attention, and a plan was hatched to buy out about 40 homeowners and move them to a new plot of land, barely 2 miles away, but 10 feet higher. The option to purchase the land was signed in early April. The state is using federal funds, specifically community development block grants designated for disaster relief, to build new homes, demolish the flood-damaged ones, and turn the old neighborhood into wetlands. Doing so will protect neighboring communities from future floods, because the restored wetlands will act as a sponge. \"It's quite clear that we're having more disasters. At the same time, I think that we are seeing less and less willingness to fund these wholesale recoveries. And consequently, we had to start doing things that are smarter,\" said Pat Forbes, executive director of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. \"One of the easiest, smartest things you can do is get people out of harm's way.\" At the gathering in the church meeting house, Forbes sought to assure the several dozen homeowners involved that they would not be affected by floods in the new area. Not only that, they could get larger, more energy-efficient homes. The homes are expected to be completed by the fall of 2020. \"It's going to be a model,\" Forbes told the gathering. The program will buy out each homeowner, but since these damaged homes have so little value now, homeowners will also get forgivable loans, up to $200,000, to buy into the new community. For each year they live in their new home, they get one-fifth of the loan forgiven. In five years, the home is theirs, debt free. The cost: roughly $8 million. An additional $4 million will be used to demolish the old neighborhood and restore it to wetlands. Curnell Jackson, who has lived in her Pecan Acres home since it was built nearly 50 years ago, was eager to hear the details. She raised her children there and is now raising her granddaughter in the barely habitable home. In the recent floods, water rose halfway up her kitchen walls, and now those walls are covered in newspaper where the drywall was removed. The floors have been ripped up, and she can no longer use gas to heat her stove due to damage in the walls. Flood insurance is far too expensive for anyone in this neighborhood. \"You're losing everything. You don't have time to pick up or, you know, anything. And you just got to go back and start all over again. I mean, it's just  it's just miserable,\" said Jackson. In the past, the federal government has given flooded homeowners money to relocate, but this is one of the first plans to move an entire community to higher ground. And it could be a model for the future. \"When we get done with this, we and everyone else will know more about how to do this and more about the mistakes to avoid than we know right now,\" said Forbes. \"One thing we're starting to figure out is that what's extremely important to having successful neighborhoods in the future and resilient neighborhoods, is when people are close to each other and they're looking out for each other.\" The state of Louisiana is doing something similar with Isle de Jean Charles, an island sinking into the Gulf of Mexico, due to rising sea levels. In early January, the state announced it paid close to $12 million for a 515-acre property about 40 miles north of the island. Forbes is also leading that project. For Jackson, Pecan Acres will still be the same tight-knit community, even a few miles down the road. \"We all in it together. And, you know, I'm not just happy for myself, but I'm happy for everybody else. 'Cause we done been through a lot,\" she said, standing in front of her flood-damaged home. \"I'm ready to go.\" -- CNBC's Erica Posse and Lisa Rizzolo contributed to this article."

        "header": "These companies are trying to predict what climate change will do to real estate investments",
        "content": "Investors are turning to a new breed of high-tech start-ups that can measure the risk climate change poses to real estate  from an hour to decades into the future. And these firms count major corporations and cities as clients. One of them is Jupiter. \"We're essentially physically modeling what's happening with the atmosphere and the water or the fire at a very specific level of detail, and typically at the asset level, which is now only possible because computers have gotten so powerful and relatively inexpensive,\" said Rich Sorkin, CEO of Jupiter. Launched barely three years ago, the Silicon Valley-based company already has over $40 million in investor capital from firms including Energize Ventures, Ignition Partners and Data Collective. It also receives funding from the National Science Foundation and NASA for work in cloud computing and satellite observations. The company's primary goal is to incorporate climate impact data on flood, fire, heat, drought, cold, wind and hail events into risk modeling for real estate assets. Its clients include the coastal cities of New York and Miami. \"We're seeing a dramatic expansion in large corporations coming to us, unsolicited, and saying, 'We need to understand the risk to this office complex or the risk to this hotel, or the risk to this power plant, or refinery, or neighborhood where we have hundreds of millions of dollars of mortgages out,'\" Sorkin said. He compared this new focus on climate risk to when cyber risks became a major threat. \"If you were a major corporation 10 years ago and somebody said 'cyber risk,' chances were a lot of people would say, 'What's that?' Now every large entity on the planet, business, financial services, governments, they are managing to cyber risks. It's just a fundamental part of their business,\" Sorkin said. \"And the same thing will be true with risk from severe weather, accounting for the climate change that's already occurred and is inevitably coming over the next several years as well.\" At Jupiter offices in Silicon Valley, New York and Boulder, Colorado, a staff of about 50, including a Nobel prize recipient and the former head of satellite data systems at Google, analyze specific properties using thousands of predictive data points. They then give clients a risk score going out up to 50 years from now. Last year, when Typhoon Mangkhut lashed Hong Kong last summer, and Hurricane Florence simultaneously hammered Wilmington, North Carolina, Mary Ludgin was watching it all from a tower in Chicago. The head of global investment research at Heitman, a major real estate investment firm, Ludgin measures risk across the firm's approximately $42 billion in property assets under management across four continents. Climate risk is the new frontier. \"We see it as the unexplored risk that we need to try to quantify,\" Ludgin said. Heitman partnered with the Urban Land Institute  in a groundbreaking study on climate risk and real estate decision- making. It concluded that overall the real estate markets \"are far from understanding climate risks enough to price them in today ... but those who are prepared have the potential to outperform.\" \"And we wanted to sharpen our skills and our ability to underwrite the risk of sea level rise, storm surge, wildfires, of the access to fresh water, heat stress,\" Ludgin said. So Heitman turned to Four Twenty Seven Inc., a climate data start-up based in Berkeley, California. Its name is a reference to California's previous 2020 emissions target, 427 million tons of carbon. It was founded in October 2012, just after Hurricane Sandy. This summer, the firm was acquired by Moody's, a major ratings agency. Like Jupiter, it tracks risks including hurricane, heat, extreme precipitation, and sea level rise. So far Four Twenty Seven has tracked climate impact on at least 2,000 companies and 320 REITs in 196 countries. \"Four Twenty Seven has built a strong platform for quantifying climate-related exposures and producing actionable risk metrics, which are essential to understanding and informing climate risk and resilience measures,\" Myriam Durand, global head of assessments at Moody's Investors Service, said in a release. \"Moody's is committed to offering global, transparent standards for assessing environmental risk, and the acquisition of Four Twenty Seven advances our objective of integrating climate analytics into our offerings.\" This is likely just the first of many moves toward factoring climate risk into big business and big real estate. \"Markets are just waking up to the need to do this kind of risk assessment,\" said Frank Freitas, chief development officer at Four Twenty Seven. \"For real estate, what people want to know in addition to the scores and relative exposure, is what is the world going to look like at this location in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. Am I going to have five more days of flooding or 10 more days of high heat? What are the physical, observable outcomes?\" Freitas is quick to add that they do not give investment advice. \"But we show them what the projections look like at points in time and give them an opportunity to engineer towards that,\" he added. Both Four Twenty Seven and Jupiter go well beyond what insurance companies forecast, because, unlike insurers, they don't measure risk according to the past, but to the future. \"Insurance is basically a one-year contract, at the end of which the insurer gets to say, 'Oh, we'll keep insuring you, but here's the new cost,' or, 'Sorry, insurance is no longer available given the wind risk in your location,'\" said Ludgin. \"What we learned is that risk is not being priced into the underwriting that investors do as they think about an investment in Miami, for example. It's not reflected in the price. And our investors think that what they're getting when they hire our services is the ability to underwrite risk and opportunity.\" And the risk is not just in the wind or rain or drought or fire. It is also in the cost of protecting real estate from all of them. \" What we've added into the mix is what if your insurance costs quadruple? What if your property taxes quadruple, or further beyond that quadrupling? And does the investment still make sense under that scenario?\" Ludgin said. The United States faces more than $400 billion in costs over the next 20 years to defend coastal communities from sea level rise,  according to a study by the Center for Climate Integrity and Resilient Analytics. That includes building 50,000 miles of coastal barriers in 22 states. Two years ago, residents in Miami voted themselves a $400 million bond, taxing themselves to protect their city from flooding. \"The last 2 years have really been transformative in terms of the way the business community in the United States, and for that matter all over the world, is thinking about these issues,\" said Jupiter's Sorkin. While there are few companies in the climate risk prediction field, the potential for growth is enormous. And while no model for risk assessment is perfect, technology is only getting stronger and cheaper. \"Do we know whether or not there will be tipping points in climate that create acceleration of some of the effects we're modeling? We don't, but I'd say the rigor we apply outstrips any uncertainty,\" Four Twenty Seven's Freitas said."

        "header": "Millions of homes are underinsured against natural disasters as construction costs keep rising",
        "content": "Extreme weather, from floods to wildfires to high-category hurricanes, is causing ever more damage to neighborhoods. Now, new research shows that much of the nation's housing stock may be underinsured against these disasters. The cost of rebuilding has risen significantly in the past two years and continues to rise, due to a severe construction labor shortage as well as new tariffs on materials. If these increased costs are not factored regularly into insurance coverage in disaster-prone areas, homeowners will be left with huge losses that could even resonate through the mortgage market. Homeowners who can't recover from disasters are far less likely to stay current on their mortgages; if a region is devastated, home values drop and homeowners can fall underwater on their loans. More from Rising Risks: The mortgage industry isn't ready for a foreclosure crisis created by climate change Climate change is taking a toll on the $20 billion winter sports industry  and swanky ski homes could lose value Heavier rains and catastrophic floods force cities to drain lakes, ponds with the help of cloud tech Last year, 14 different natural disasters, from record-setting wildfires in California to devastating hurricanes in Florida, cost the United States $91 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was the eighth consecutive year with at least eight disasters in the billion-dollar range. NOAA also reported that 2018 was the fourth hottest year on record and that warming not only increases the risk of drought, wildfires and stronger hurricanes, it also increases the risk of severe snowstorms. All of these changes have insurers rushing to recalculate coverage on homes that may be total losses after a natural disaster. A new report from CoreLogic looked at valuations in four disaster-prone regions and came up with some alarming numbers on the rising risk to real estate from increasingly extreme weather and higher reconstruction costs. \"Underinsurance issues can cause financial devastation for property owners, artificially low coverage limits for insurance carriers, and increased loan delinquencies,\" said Amy Gromowski, senior leader analytics at CoreLogic. \"Homeowners who experience natural hazard events, such as the California wildfires, are often struck by personal and financial devastation and many aren't able to rebuild their homes, which prolongs the region's recovery and often causes homeowners to default on their mortgages.\" Undervaluing properties for many years can create problems beyond the one-time claim, according to CoreLogic's report. If building and labor costs are not continually monitored, claims estimates may be inaccurate. In California, one of the regions studied, Corelogic identified 110,000 Southern California properties in very high to extreme risk of wildfire. With average reconstruction cost estimated at $400,000, the risk is more than $46 billion. Those costs are significantly higher than they were just two years ago because of a significant increase in the costs of labor and materials. So if just 1% of the homes at risk were a complete loss in a wildfire, given the increase in reconstruction costs over the last two years (5.6%), the undervaluation of that 1% would be $25 million if insurance coverage is not current. In coastal hurricane-prone areas along the Northeast Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions, Corelogic identified about 1.1 million properties at very high to extreme risk of loss from storm surge. In Florida alone, reconstruction of at-risk properties is estimated at $240 billion, with the recent increase in costs. \"The financial impact of not updating reconstruction costs for two years is significant,\" according to the report. \"If a catastrophic event were to affect only 5% of homes and cause just 30% storm surge damage to those 5% of properties, the reconstruction cost undervaluation is approximately $205 million.\" That is just the risk to coastlines, but if inland flooding is factored in, such as in Hurricane Harvey, the underinsurance is more widespread. Reconstruction costs in Houston have increased more than 7% in the last two years, meaning that if insurance is not current, the market coverage is undervalued by $49 million. And tornado alley is also looking at a potential shortfall in insurance coverage. In Oklahoma alone, which averages about 56 tornadoes per year, about 1.3 million properties with $257 billion in reconstruction costs are at very high or extreme risk. If insurance on these homes is not valued at current cost levels, which have increased 6.6% over the past two years, homeowners could be left with huge losses. If one tornado caused 20% damage to just 1% of the homes deemed at very high risk, the reconstruction coverage would fall short by approximately $34 million. Without adequate insurance coverage in any disaster-prone area, the risk to the mortgage market rises as well. Following three major hurricanes in 2017, serious mortgage delinquency rates tripled in the Houston and Cape Coral, Florida, metropolitan areas and quadrupled in San Juan, Puerto Rico, according to CoreLogic. The 2017 Tubbs wildfire caused serious delinquency rates to spike 50% in Santa Rosa, California. \"The disruption of a family's regular flow of income and payments, as well as substantial loss in property value, can trigger mortgage default; especially if homeowners are underinsured and cannot afford to rebuild,\" said Frank Nothaft, chief economist at CoreLogic. -- CNBC'sErica Posse andLisa Rizzolo  contributed to this report"

        "header": "Climate change will crush real estate values for investors who don't prepare, new report says",
        "content": "For any investor, measuring opportunity against risk is critical. And for real estate investors in particular, risk is rising exponentially in the age of climate change. To that end, big real estate firms are pouring significant resources into calculating climate risk and its likely effect on property portfolios  everything from increasingly extreme weather to a rise in sea levels. \"This process will be painful for investors who are caught off guard, but those who are prepared have the potential to outperform,\"  a new report from the Urban Land Institute said . Damage to U.S. real estate from extreme storms hit a record high in 2017. Natural disasters, including floods, mudslides and wildfires, cost more than $300 billion in damage, the bulk of it to residential and commercial real estate. In 2018, from May through July, much of the East Coast, down to Florida, saw rainfall up to three times normal levels, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Nine of the top 10 years for one-day extreme precipitation events have occurred since 1990, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), because as the atmosphere warms, clouds hold more water. All of these statistics are not just alarming, they are sounding the alarm bells for the real estate investment sector, because it is most vulnerable. \"Understanding and mitigating climate risk is a complex and evolving challenge for real estate investors,\" said ULI's CEO, Edward Walter. \"Risks such as sea level rise and heat stress will increasingly highlight the vulnerability not only of individual assets and locations, but of entire metropolitan areas.\" The report highlights how real estate investment companies are now prioritizing the risk of climate change and creating new approaches to better gauge and develop mitigation strategies. \"Building for resilience, on a portfolio, property and citywide basis, is paramount to staying competitive. Factoring in climate risk is becoming the new normal for our industry,\" added Walter. Some of the strategies, according to the report, include: \"Investors see climate considerations as a necessary layer of fiduciary responsibility to their stakeholders, as well as an opportunity to identify markets and assets that will benefit from a changing climate,\" according to the report. \"While early adapters have committed resources to gain knowledge and improve awareness of climate risk, in the coming years, methods are likely to become more sophisticated.\" It also highlights the potential return on investment from putting resources into mitigation strategies for real estate assets. Heitman, a Chicago-based real estate investment firm with nearly $34 billion in assets under management globally, worked with ULI on the report and is putting heavy resources, both financial and personnel, into measuring and balancing climate risk. \"The industry didn't seem to be pricing in these kinds of risks,\" said Mary Ludgin, senior managing director and head of global investment research at Heitman. \"When we began the project of trying to identify the climate risk inherent in individual properties, we first looked to our insurers. They were less of a help than we were expecting.\" That is because insurers reprice annually, and therefore do not look at long-term models. FEMA flood plains are reassessed about every five years, but they still don't account for the increasingly extreme weather and heavier rainfall that parts of the United States are now seeing. \"We can't try to determine what's going to happen in 12 months beyond, because insurance is set up for what your risk is today. And it wouldn't meet actuarial science to charge you for a future potential,\" said David Maurstad, FEMA's deputy associate administrator for federal insurance and mitigation and chief executive of the National Flood Insurance Program. Heitman is, therefore, going beyond traditional insurance predictions to factor climate risk into its investments. It hired a Berkeley, California-based firm called 427, one of a new cottage industry of companies that assess climate risk to real estate. It's mission, according to the website, is to catalyze climate adaptation and resilience investments by enabling the integration of climate science into business and policy decisions. \"They were able to provide us an assessment of flooding, wildfires, wind-related disasters, and we can then aggregate that up to what is Heitman's total exposure globally or a specific client's exposure on the individual buildings they own. They can assess potential acquisitions and the risk that they represent,\" said Ludgin. These risks include not just the destruction from individual natural disasters but business disruptions for property tenants and higher operating and capital costs caused by increased wear and tear on properties from more extreme weather. As a whole, the industry needs to understand the pricing impacts of physical climate risks, and how climate change is likely to have a bigger impact on valuation in the future as asset and market liquidity are affected, the ULI report says. And it's not just storms and sea level rise, but the potential higher costs associated with protecting cities and municipalities from both.  In Miami, for example, the city is investing $200 million into resilience , installing pump stations and upgrading its infrastructure. Miami Beach is on track to spend twice that, raising sidewalks and seawalls. The money is coming from new bonds  voters raising their own property taxes to protect their property. \"Are taxes going to rise?\" asked Ludgin. \"We are looking at scenarios where taxes quadruple in the period that we hold the property. You can assume that federal, state, and local governments will play a role, and that means a climate in which taxes are likely rising.\" All of it is a new and now necessary part of what real estate investors, developers and managers need to do to factor opportunity against risk. \"They are trying to think about how their portfolio is balanced and make sure they're not overexposed in a market that has more risk,\" said Walter. \"Not redlining markets, but investors are trying to be thoughtful about the level of exposure to those markets.\" That is because higher-risk assets will eventually see downward repricing, as the market redirects capital to locations and individual assets where it is expected to be better insulated from these particular risks, the ULI report said. -- CNBC'sErica Posse andLisa Rizzolo  contributed to this report"

        "content": "Skiers in the western U.S. are enjoying one of the best seasons in years. But experts warn that years like this are quickly becoming the exception, not the rule. Snow sport seasons are getting shorter, due to warmer temperatures. That is already having a distinguishable financial impact on residential and resort properties that profit from snow. Vail Resorts , the largest player in the U.S. ski field, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings in its latest report but had to lower its full-year guidance because of a weak start to the season. The company's CEO, Robert Katz, attributed that \"to guest concerns after two prior years of poor pre-holiday conditions.\" The amount of snow in the west has seen an average drop of 41 percent since the early 1980s, according to research  just published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters . As a result, the snow season shrunk by 34 days. Snow sports tourism contributes about $20 billion to the U.S. economy each year, according to researchers at the University of New Hampshire and Colorado State University. The bulk of that spending is at ski resorts, like Colorado-based Vail Resorts. \"We do hear from shareholders quite a bit about this weather variability,\" said Katz. \"If I'm going to invest in Vail Resorts, how do I know that you can consistently drive results, even though you are subject to the weather, the snowfall, the temperatures? And we have, over the last 10 years, really made a point of showcasing to our investors that we are not only doing the right thing for the environment, but we are also changing our business model.\" Vail resorts operates 15 mountain resorts across the U.S. Canada and Australia. It also owns luxury hotels and a real estate development company. Katz's answer to the climate threat against his company is to fight it from the ground up. Lead by example and at the same time protect the business. \"Our sustainability practices are critical to our long-term sustainability as a company, and the financial performance that we can deliver,\" he said. In 2017, Katz announced a commitment to using 100 percent renewable energy. That means solar panels and transitioning to more energy efficient snow making. Yes, snow guns in Colorado. The company is also buying more properties, recently in Vermont and Australia, a geographical weather hedge. By diversifying the properties, Katz aims to protect against weather variability place to place. Vail Resorts also introduced a season lift pass that works at all of the company's properties but must be purchased before the season starts. The \"Epic Pass\" is yet another weather hedge for both skiers and the company, protecting both against warmer winters with less snowfall in certain places. \"Anything that's out there that could be a risk to our business, we have to factor in. And it's one of the reasons why we did launch this season pass. And it's one of the reasons why we built geographic diversity,\" Katz said. \"It's one of the reasons why we have invested in lots of other activities that people can do at our resorts, so when they come to our resorts there's lots of different choices for people. All of those things are critical for us.\" That also means investing in new options that turn the winter wonderland into a summer playground  like zip lines and mountain coasters for summer tourists. It appears to be working. Summer tax revenue for 2016 was 34 percent higher in Vail than four years before, according to the town of Vail. These strategies may add to the resort's bottom line, but residential real estate in mountain villages is far more dependent on snow. Home values in mountain towns like Vail and Aspen are some of the highest in the nation, and those values are at risk. By 2050, home values near ski resorts could drop by at least 15 percent due to warmer winters, according to a study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin. At lower elevation ski areas, such as in Utah, Idaho, Nevada and parts of California, they could fall as much as 55 percent. Josh Lautenberg sells multimillion dollar homes in the Vail area, some of which are used for just a few winter months each year. He was stunned by the poor conditions to start last year's ski season. \"That was the first delayed opening that I've seen since I've moved here in 1991,\" he said, noting the slow start to business this year. \"I think a lot of people were a little bit gun shy from last year. Deposits on hotels, and rental properties, and everything else.\" Snow doesn't just support luxury home values  it is the lifeblood of the local economy. Most of the jobs in Vail, whether in hospitality, retail, restaurant or real estate are supported by tourism dollars. \"So we do certainly worry that we wouldn't be able to sustain one or two or three consecutive years low snow volume due to climate change,\" said Lautenberg. \"And as far as the real estate business that I own and that I also am a broker within, what will happen? You know, where is my livelihood in the future, in three to four, five years?\" -- CNBC's  Erica Posse  and Lisa Rizzolo   contributed to this report"

        "header": "This fire-resistant home is the next line of defense against climate change",
        "content": "It is impossible to build a fully fireproof home, but researchers are now focused on making homes at least fire resistant. They have to, because climate change is increasing the intensity of wildfires around the world, putting billions of dollars' worth of real estate literally in the line of fire. Wildfires destroyed more U.S. homes and buildings last year than at any other point in recorded history, and the eight most destructive years for wildfires ever have been in the last 13 years. \"There is no reason to think they are going to get better,\" said Roy Wright, CEO of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety. \"You look at this kind of impact  the variations in the climate we have had, we are far more susceptible to the size and intensity of fires.\" Roughly 14,000 homes burned to the ground in just two of the enormous California wildfires last year. Wildfire damage to residential and commercial property in California alone last year totaled nearly $19 billion, according to CoreLogic. The rainy season in California is getting shorter and the droughts more prolonged, meaning there is simply more combustible material and a greater chance of wildfires. But it is not just California. Wright points to increasingly intense wildfires recently in Colorado, Texas, Florida, Tennessee and South Carolina. All of those states have huge homebuilding industries. \"There are steps that we can take so that the impact of that fire is narrowed, it doesn't spread as far, and it impacts far fewer structures,\" said Wright. Wright's insurance institute built two test homes at its facility in Richburg, South Carolina, one a typical structure, the other using fire-resistant materials and landscaping. Using large fans and ember generators, it showed how quickly one house erupted in flames, while the other did not. Though a wildfire's wall of flame might look most destructive, 90 percent of fires are ignited by flying embers, some the size of a human hand. \"Fire resistance means you've incorporated building materials and design features that will get the ember exposure, will get the fire exposure, but would resist it,\" said Daniel Gorham, research engineer with the institute. The siding on the fire-resistant home was a fiber cement composite, rather than typical wood shingles or planks. This composite is offered in different colors and designs that look just like wood. Landscaping was also key. The typical home had mulch, the fire-resistant home, rocks. The fire resistant home also had all its plantings at least 5 feet from the siding and the siding was raised 6 inches off the ground. \"We have noncombustible landscaping. In this case, we have rock mulch from zero to 5 feet away from the building. We also have the ornamental vegetation outside of that 5-foot zone, and spaced strategically,\" said Gorham. Satellites have captured embers flying up to 7 miles from a wildfire. These start secondary fires. The embers can land in gutters and siding and smolder for up to 12 hours before they ignite. Using metal instead of vinyl gutters mitigates fire risk: vinyl can melt and drop fire onto the side of the house  metal will not. Windows and doors also need fortification in the line of fire. \"We have a dual-paned, tempered glass window, and we have a fiberglass door. Dual-paned is important because if we do get a fire here, single-paned glass would break, and then we have a window break, we now have a breach in the opening and that's when flames and embers can get into the home,\" said Gorham. While the cost to real estate from wildfires is rising, the cost to build and landscape a fireproof home is actually the same or slightly less than the cost of a typical home. The savings is in the cement siding, cheaper than wood materials. That offsets cost increases in gutters and vents. In the institute's experiment, with equal amounts of embers blowing on them, the fire-resistant home did not burn at all, while the typical home, which was connected to it, was fully engulfed. \"This work that we do here in the lab, this is real. I think all too often, we can watch something on TV, we can listen to it and go, 'That's interesting, but it won't happen to me.' But it does. It invades a family's life,\" said Wright. Wright is a former FEMA official and native Californian. His parents lost their home in California's Camp fire last year, the worst in the state's history. \"I've always led my team saying, 'Make sure we know the names of those people,' but when that fire came through Paradise  and you get the text message from your mom that says, 'Our home is gone. Where do I start?'  the nature of how destructive it is hits home,\" said Wright. -- CNBC'sErica Posse andLisa Rizzolo  contributed to this report"

        "header": "The mortgage industry isn't ready for a foreclosure crisis created by climate change",
        "content": "A foreclosure crisis spurred by climate change is becoming a real threat to the mortgage industry as extreme storms and other natural disasters increasingly occur in places where borrowers might not have flood or fire insurance. The industry is not prepared for the effects of such extreme weather and rising sea levels, according to Ed Delgado, CEO of national mortgage trade association the Five Star institute and a former executive at Freddie Mac. \"If we look at the basic foundation of what drives the mortgage market, it is the application of credit risk. What's missing is the understanding of weather risk and where those weather events can take place,\" Delgado said. The current system is reactive and local and doesn't include plans for the widespread effects of climate change. That could affect several major housing markets at once. As it stands, after major natural disasters, mortgage servicers follow guidelines from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA, which own or insure most home loans today. The guidelines usually involve a temporary moratorium on foreclosures, as well as loan forbearance programs, which allow borrowers to miss a few months of payments but then extend the length of the loan. This helps borrowers who need to rebuild and may be waiting for insurance payments to repair damage. It also helps people who have lost their salaries temporarily due to a disaster. Again, these are momentary solutions to singular events. The mortgage market is not factoring the overall risk into its loan underwriting and is not quantifying the amount of potential losses should a wide swath of borrowers walk away from damaged or destroyed homes . \"Whether it's fires and mudslides in California, flooding in Texas, or tornadoes in the Oklahoma region,\" Delgado said. \"It's going to be a problem if the banks don't start to pay closer attention to what those weather risks are.\" As an example, Hurricane Harvey, which struck in August 2017, flooded close to 100,000 Houston-area homes. In Harvey's federally declared disaster areas, 80 percent of the homes had no flood insurance, because they weren't normally prone to flooding. Serious mortgage delinquencies on damaged homes jumped more than 200 percent, according to CoreLogic. Houston could have seen a massive foreclosure crisis were it not for strong investor demand in the market. Houston's economy was strong before the storm, and its housing stock was lean. After the storm, investors swarmed the market, offering troubled homeowners an easy way out, largely in cash. Investor purchases of 10 or more properties jumped nearly 50 percent in the year following Harvey, according to Attom Data Solutions. Some were large-scale buyers, like Cerberus Capital and HomeVestors of America. Others were smaller home flippers, like JP Patel, who was still buying properties at a crowded auction event in Houston last October. His company, Texas-based Myers, has purchased 80 Harvey-damaged properties. \"As an investor, it was kind of a perfect opportunity,\" said Patel. \"We literally can avoid the whole problematic nature of the foreclosure process.\" Houston dodged a crisis because it was already a hot housing market, and people still wanted to live there after the storm. But Houston should be a wake-up call to the rest of the nation, according to Delgado, specifically because the damaged homes were largely not in FEMA flood plains, and were therefore not required to have flood insurance. \"You have this tremendous urbanization, population growth. Roads that are being built in the last 10 years. Where does the water go?\" Delgado asked. \"And is there an underlying risk for us to examine with respect to our portfolio? And then make decisions. Should we be lending in those markets?\" Lenders today, and the federal government that backs most loans, base their risk on FEMA's flood maps, but even top FEMA officials admit the maps don't account for increasingly extreme weather. \"We can't try to determine what's going to happen in 12 months beyond, because insurance is set up for what your risk is today. And it wouldn't meet actuarial science to charge you for a future potential,\" said David Maurstad, FEMA's deputy associate administrator for Insurance and Mitigation. FEMA is required to update its maps every five years. Maurstad says it relies heavily on local communities reporting problems  but some don't because they don't want their insurance premiums to go up. \"We know that only one-third of the properties in the high-risk area have flood insurance, so we have a lot of work to do,\" he said. In Houston, flood insurance is now far more expensive because of Harvey. Amanda LeCureux has been running foreclosure auctions for the past two decades, but last October it was the past two years that had her most concerned. \"I have a homeowner, for example, who flooded in 2016 and then promptly flooded again in 2017. And while they did have flood insurance, that flood insurance used to cost them $600 a year. The projected premium for next year is $9,000,\" said LeCureux. \"And that particular homeowner was stating that, while they can afford to pay the $9,000 for flood insurance alone, they just don't know that they're interested in staying in that home where they've already flooded twice in two years and with the increase in insurance,\" she added. And that brings up another problem, said LeCureux. \"Who's going to buy their home? Which homeowner is going to buy the home that's been flooded two times and then will be burdened with a $9,000 flood insurance policy?\" Borrowers may simply decide to walk away from homes that they either can't afford to rebuild or no longer want to live in. As extreme storms and weather events, including drought and wildfires, become more frequent and widespread, the potential for a climate-induced foreclosure crisis increases. So far, according to Delgado, the mortgage industry has not caught up with the new climate reality and its increasing risk. \"I think it's only been in the last decade that we've started to understand that [Hurricane] Katrina wasn't a fluke, that there will be ongoing, massive events, weather events, taking place, exposing potentially trillions of dollars of real estate to coastal flooding and damages,\" said Delgado. \"It simply can't be ignored anymore. We've been given enough warning signs to take corrective action, and it's about time you get proactive instead of waiting for these cataclysmic events to take place.\" -- CNBC's Erica Posse and Lisa Rizzolo served as producers."

        "header": "Here's how to build a hurricane-resistant house \u2014 not as expensive as you may think",
        "content": "June marks the official start of hurricane season in the U.S., and after years of  increasingly powerful storms  wreaking record destruction,  homeowners and builders are looking intensely at ways to fortify their homes . While there is no such thing as a hurricane-proof home, there are v arying levels of resistance and investment . Florida imposed new mandatory building codes after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, at first locally and then statewide in 2002. They have improved hurricane resistance dramatically in new construction there. Florida's standard is the highest mandatory code in the nation. The Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety has gone even further. A decade ago it created a \"fortified home\" standard to protect against hurricanes and hail. It is a voluntary guideline, and so far only 12,000 homes nationwide have built to that designation. Those that do sell for 7% more, according to a University of Alabama study. The standard has three levels, bronze, silver and gold, with the last being the highest protection. Since Florida's codes are already so high, building to the gold standard there wouldn't add much to the price of construction. But in areas that have weak codes or lack them altogether, the gold standard would be much more costly. The biggest driver of those costs is in impact-resistant windows and doors, shutter systems and upgrades to any other openings that expose a home to the elements. In Mississippi, for example, it would cost $3,000 to $5,000 more to build an 1,800-square-foot home to gold standards versus basic code standards, according to the IBHS. That range is likely similar in other states as well. The cost in Florida however would only increase by about $1,000, since codes there already cover most of the upgrades. Some homeowners have pursued even more robust measures to protect their investments, though they are the exception. In Florida's panhandle, Category 5 Hurricane Michael tore a massive path of destruction in October, but one home on Mexico Beach sat relatively unscathed amid the wreckage. Russell King and his nephew has it built primarily as  a retirement home  for King, an attorney in Tennessee. Even before the concrete pillars were poured, they had hurricane wind-resistance not just in mind, but in every aspect of the design. The home sits 12 feet  above  the ground and is anchored 28 feet  into  the ground.   King went well beyond any standards and, while he wouldn't give an exact figure, spent many thousands of dollars specifically on hurricane-resistant materials. \"I said from the beginning, we have to have a concrete house,\" said King. \"I want poured concrete walls because I felt like it had a better chance of fighting the storm.\" Of the roughly 800,000 homes built nationwide in 2017, barely 8% had concrete frames, according to the U.S. Census Department. Now, seven months later, despite his success, King says his precautions didn't go far enough. \"The storms are, in my opinion, from what I've seen getting stronger,\" he said, standing on the sun-drenched beach in front of his home. He learned many lessons from Michael and is upgrading his home yet again. \"We put probably 100, maybe 200 Simpson hurricane clips up there,\" he said pointing to the third-floor ceiling as he walked through the home. \"All this cross-bracing is new. All that foam, it's new, that happened last month. All these light fixtures here, they're all going away, every one of them.\" He is also breaking up much of the concrete on the ground, because the tidal surge caused it to push up against the pillars, cracking them during the storm. He said he will likely add stone pavers, which have spaces in between, and will therefore not push up against the columns. He pointed all this out, just as his next-door neighbor's home was being bulldozed. It was built two years ago to the highest local code, but it was a total loss. More from Rising Risks: Climate change will crush real estate values for investors Millions of homes are underinsured against natural disasters This fire-resistant home is the next line of defense against climate change While the technology to fortify these homes has improved dramatically, the demand for it has not. That may be because  homeowners mistakenly believe that it is wildly expensive . In most cases, it is not, particularly in Florida where codes are already quite stringent. \"I wouldn't describe it as cost prohibitive,\" said Lance Rettig, executive director with Habitat for Humanity in Panama City, Florida. \"We actually focus on low to moderate-income homeowners, and this is built balancing that along with safety.\" Habitat has built 81 homes in the Panama City area. It builds beyond the latest hurricane codes, and can do that even on the lowest-priced homes. \"The cost is very low on these,\" Rettig said, pointing to metal rods in the walls. \"These are a couple dollars each, if that. The steel roof does add an incremental cost that would add about 10% to the [cost of the] home. The rest of the things that I'm talking about are almost negligible, maybe $1,000 on a $75,000 four-bedroom house.\" In other states it would cost more to get to Gold, but it would still not be cost-prohibitive, according to Rettig. There are levels of protection, just as there are categories of hurricane strength. The latest Habitat homes fared better than their neighbors in Hurricane Michael. But King isn't taking any chances. \"We'll spend easily another $100,000,\" he said. Does he believe there is such a thing as a hurricane-proof house? \"No. No,\" he said.

        "header": "Cities are using new cloud technology to fight increasingly expensive and catastrophic flooding",
        "content": "Intense storms are becoming much more frequent, resulting in heavier rainfall and flooding that wreaks havoc on local infrastructures, budgets and economies. This summer was one of the wettest on record in much of the Northeast. Study after study have shown that storms with extreme rain are becoming more common, and consequently posing a new challenge to old, outdated stormwater systems in cities large and small. Most of the nations stormwater systems are simply unable to handle the increasingly heavy rainfall. And it gets worse as urban development increases because there are fewer places for water to go. Thats why, instead of looking on the ground for answers, new companies are turning to the technology cloud to find ways to manage what comes out of the sky. One four-year-old company, Boston-based Opti, installs underground smart water management systems that connect to the technology cloud and track the weather. The systems control water coming into and out of urban lakes, retention ponds, tanks, pipes, cisterns, even constructed wetlands. Were able to take the weather forecast and use it to predict how much runoff is going to occur, and drain the facility down in advance to create new storage without building a new major capital asset, Opti CEO Marcus Quigley said. By draining the water before the storm hits, the tanks, lakes or ponds have the capacity to hold much more water when the intense rains fall. In Albany, New York, two summers ago, a few random rainstorms caused over $3 million in damage to sewers overwhelmed by unusually heavy water. That is why Joseph Coffey, commissioner of Albanys Department of Water and Water Supply, turned to Opti. Ive been here 4 years, and I think what we call the rain bomb storms have been a little bit more severe, particularly this year, Coffey said. These extreme rainfall events are causing flooding, basement backups and combined sewer overflows into the Hudson River. Opti installed its system in Washington Park Lake, right in the heart of the citys downtown, as well as one of Albanys constructed wetlands. In the lake, the water is held back by a large panel, which makes sure the level is maintained at a certain elevation. At the bottom, a valve is connected to cloud infrastructure through a nearby control box. The system watches the weather every second. When the cloud says a storm is coming, the valve opens to drain the lake, making room for more rainwater. So far its been a relatively short period of time that weve had it in play, but its worked great. We seem like we have less of a frequency of the flooding in the streets, and we probably have managed this backup in the basements pretty well, Coffey said. But the other benefit that it has, we probably have fewer combined sewer overflow events in the Hudson River, and thats a big benefit for us because thats a regulatory issue. The system also saved the city a considerable amount of money, sparing the need to build new drains, sewers and reservoirs. Typically, the savings are in the range, on the capital side, from 50 to 90 percent, and you can tell what that probably means to local communities. We all know there isnt enough money to go around, Quigley said. The potential for companies like Opti is huge. From May through July, much of the East Coast saw rainfall up to three times normal levels, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Nine of the top 10 years for one-day extreme precipitation events have occurred since 1990, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The more water, the more expensive the damage. According to Quigley, nearly a million sites nationwide could use Optis technology to control flooding. Opti now has more than 130 systems deployed in 21 states and is in major cities including New York, Pittsburgh and Chicago. Optis revenue has grown tenfold in its four years, doubling last year alone, according to Quigley. Its largest private investors are Sidewalk Labs, Missionpoint Partners and Ecosystem Integrity Fund. We love simple tech solutions that have a lot of power, and this is the kind of thing that is beautiful because it saves customers money, particularly in old cities, said James Everett, co-founder of the Ecosystem Integrity Fund. We believe that tools like this should become best practices. Its new for municipalities. Its not the way theyve typically thought. We invested about a year and a half ago, where we thought the company was starting to emerge from the difficult pilot stage. We believe its going accelerate. While Opti is using its technology to manage and direct water underground, another company is setting its sights and its technology higher, literally, on rooftops. Rainbank is a recent start-up that turns rooftops into reservoirs. Its system is now employed on the roof of the Water Department in New Orleans. Much like Opti, it also uses cloud technology connected to valves. Instead of ponds, it uses rooftops to hold water during heavy rainstorms and then release it slowly once the storms have passed. These devices are remotely controlled, said Rainbank CEO Kevin Dutt. They talk to each other, and they also talk to our server in the cloud, and our server is running algorithms, evaluating a storm and deciding when is going to be the most intense period of a storm. With that information, it tells these valves when to close, when to start collecting water. Dutt insists the rooftops dont leak because they are built structurally to hold a lot more water or weight than they actually do. So we dont take a risk in any way in that way, he said. The technology Rainbank uses is also relatively cheap. It is nothing compared with what increasingly intense storms are costing local economies. Its really becoming debilitating to the infrastructure of our cities, Dutt said. It is limiting transportation and movement of commerce around the city. Its also causing damage, which is actually costing cities and private owners money to fix infrastructure damage. So far, Rainbank is on rooftops in a dozen cities, including Philadelphia, Milwaukee and St. Louis. The U.S. spends about $5 billion to $10 billion a year on storm water mitigation. We think we can be a major player in that potential market, Dutt said. This week, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced the Resilient Boston Harbor initiative, which aims to protect the citys 47-mile shoreline from major flooding due to climate change. This follows an extremely wet winter of back-to-back noreasters that left much of the citys downtown and seaport districts underwater. Walsh said the city will commit 10 percent of all new capital funding, or about $16 million annually, to resilience projects. Were not just planning for the next storm well face. Were planning for the storms the next generation will face, Walsh said. A resilient, climate-ready Boston Harbor presents an opportunity to protect Boston, connect Boston, and enhance Boston, now and for the future. As we enter a new era in our harbors history, Boston can show the world that resilience is not only the ability to survive adversity, but to emerge even stronger than before. -- CNBCs Erica Posse and Lisa Rizzolo contributed to this report"

        "header": "Rising Risks: \u2018Climate gentrification\u2019 is changing Miami real estate values\u00a0\u2013 for better and worse",
        "content": "A modern glass home sits on the edge of the water in Miami Beach. The ground-level master suite has a soaking tub that looks out to the ocean, and the bedrooms glass doors allow the owner to roll out of the sheets and onto the yacht. It is listed for sale at $25 million. Another  Miami  home sits on a garbage-strewn street in Little Haiti, about five miles inland. Its owner can walk out the front door and see a dead chicken in the street. It is listed for sale at $559,000, but some experts claim it is a better investment than $25 million mansion. The mansion, while highly desirable and exquisitely appointed, is paradise at a price, because rising tides and increasingly extreme storms may already be lowering its value. On the other hand, the home in Little Haiti, which sits on high ground with little risk of flooding, is appreciating at a fast clip. It has nearly doubled in value in just the past two years, according to Zillow. What we see here is a theory of climate gentrification that suggests that in Miami, higher elevation land will be worth more, said Harvard Universitys Jesse Keenan, who co-authored the first peer-reviewed study offering evidence of the existence of a climate change signal in the real estate market. The study tracked the values of more than 100,000 single-family homes across Miami going back 45 years. What we found is that the higher elevation properties are essentially worth more now, and increasingly will be worth more in the future, Keenan said. Populations, including speculative real estate investment will densify in these high elevation areas. Keenan claims home values on Miamis coast are already worth 10 percent less now than they would be if climate change didnt exist. Universities, climate research groups and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have made dire predictions about sea-level rise in Miami  the ocean overtaking vast swaths of real estate over the coming decades. So-called nuisance flooding, when king tides come in on sunny days, is already common in some neighborhoods. That, argues Keenan, is why wealthier investors are now displacing low-income residents in high-elevation neighborhoods, like Little Haiti. Fabiola Fleuranvil is a real estate investor and community activist in the area. She is trying to educate local residents about the rising value of their properties. All the community sees is just new people, newcomers coming into the community, buying up properties, raising their property values and property taxes, pricing them out, Fleuranvil said while walking down the street with the $599,000 listing. Youre in a pocket where there could be $80,000 to $100,000 properties, and heres one here, an outlier, thats about half a million dollars. The home, which was purchased out of foreclosure by an investor, was fully renovated and will likely sell to another investor. If you have a smart investor and developer, and hes already seeing whats happening with one smart property, and he acquires the rest of the properties next to it, within a quick year or two, youll see this community change. And its happened pretty rapidly, Fleuranvil said. It is already apparent on the busy retail street by the home. An entire row of formerly Haitian-owned businesses are empty and being gutted. On one side of the street, a sleek and trendy high-end coffee company has already moved in, in stark contrast to the ethnic stores. You have long-time commercial tenants who have been here for 10, 15, 20 years, and new investors and developers no longer want their rent checks. Why? Because now, theyre redeveloping it, said Fleuranvil. Part of what is behind Little Haitis gentrification, however, is just the growing trend toward urbanism. It has nothing to do with water. Millennials in cities across the nation are migrating to urban centers, choosing less expensive and more ethnic neighborhoods to inhabit. Investors, however, while following demand, are increasingly attuned to the threat of water and are developing projects in higher-elevation neighborhoods at a faster pace. Miami native David Martins Terra Group, a commercial and residential developer, just finished a luxury waterfront condominium tower in Coconut Grove, with sweeping water views, and is building more next door. He is also building a $162 million residential and commercial development on 5 acres adjoining a metro rail station further inland. I would say water, for a firm like ours, is becoming a decision maker, as it relates to strategies for investment. I definitely do, said Martin. Martin said he embraces the analysis in Keenans study but believes many factors go into the financial decision of buying and selling real estate beyond just water risk and elevation. He added that the study does not bring in flood mitigation enough, specifically how waterfront towers will actually help protect Miami from future flood disasters. We look at areas that are on the beach and along the coast, and we say, well, how can we fortify these buildings? How can we create incremental tax revenues from these areas along the beach or along the coast and start reinvesting that incremental tax dollar into the infrastructure in order to make those neighborhoods more resilient? Martin said. The city of Miami is already investing nearly $200 million into resilience, installing pump stations and upgrading its infrastructure. Miami Beach is on track to spend twice that, raising sidewalks and seawalls. The money is coming from new bonds  voters raising their own property taxes to protect their property. You can argue with climate gentrification and whether its a good theory or not, but you cant argue with the science and the economics behind that proposition that this is a signal. We found it. Its already happening, argued Keenan. Martin wouldnt say the project hes developing on higher ground is specifically climate gentrification, but he said: This would be an example of a solution to adapt and mitigate from flooding. We need to move density into areas that are less vulnerable. When asked whether he was hedging his bets by building on the water as well as inland, he replied, I think there are opportunities in both areas. Because while real estate values are rising on higher ground, demand is still high on the coast. Real estate agent Danny Hertzberg, the listing agent on the $25 million property, said he doesnt fully buy the climate gentrification thesis, although he admitted his clients are more wary of rising water. The main change I see is that people are a lot more focused on new construction, modern homes, because the newer homes, with our new code, theyre at a higher elevation. So thats been a change, Hertzberg said. I dont think people are going to give up the beauty of living on the water, having their boat out front. I mean, people come here from all over the world to live on the water. Another recent study from the University of Colorado and University of Pennsylvania found that homes exposed to sea level rise nationwide sell for approximately 7 percent less than unexposed properties that are the same distance from the beach. The discount, it claims, has grown over time, driven by sophisticated buyers and investors worried about global warming. -- CNBCsErica Posse andLisa Rizzolo  contributed to this report Correction: This story was revised to delete two incorrect references to the name of the gentrifying neighborhood. Its Little Haiti."

        "header": "Amazon's HQ2 in Queens will be 'square in the danger zone for frequent flooding'",
        "content": "Long Island City in Queens, N.Y., may seem ideal for  Amazon . Directly across the East River from Manhattan, it offers stunning views, easy access to transportation, and shiny new residential towers already rising by the water. But there is a growing risk to it: The proposed 4 million to 8 million square-foot complex would be located in a flood plain. New research from Climate Central and Zillow shows the area could see significant coastal flooding by 2020. By 2050, extreme projections of sea level rise have low-lying buildings under water. \"One of the reasons Amazon got so big was long-term thinking, but building in the lowest spot in Queens is not long-term thinking,\" said Benjamin Strauss, CEO and chief scientist at Climate Central. \"This is clearly building square in the danger zone for frequent flooding.\" Amazon can build sea walls and barriers and take other steps to make its new headquarters resilient, like developers are doing at nearby Brooklyn Navy Yards' new Dock 72, that literally hangs over the water. It is a collaboration by Boston Properties and Rudin Management. \"We have a very strong plan in terms of sustainability and dealing with storms,\" said William Rudin, CEO of Rudin Management. \"Our lobby is 8 feet above the water level. All the mechanicals are on the second and third floor. We are very focused on resiliency.\" The same is true at the massive Hudson Yards development on Manhattan's West Side, also built right by a river but over train yards, so it is elevated. Amazon could raise the ground under its new offices and raise all the building systems. \"Whenever you do things that are different that haven't been done, you're going to have greater cost,\" said Stephen Ross, Chairman of the Related Companies, which is developing Hudson Yards. \"So we're able to offer, really, a resilient community, embracing all the latest in technology, in every aspect of it.\" Superstorm Sandy caused massive flooding in Long Island City, and the area now experiences floods almost any time there is a heavy downpour. \"And the truth is, heavy rain has already increased by 50 percent in the Northeast. So we can expect that trend to continue. It gets warmer, it means the air can hold more moisture and we get bigger downpours,\" said Strauss of Climate Central. From 2005 to 2014, Queens saw an additional 31 days of coastal flooding due to climate change, researchers say. If Queens experienced a 6-foot flood, which scientists expect by the end of this century, that would put $13 billion worth of property at risk of damage, including about 34,000 homes, according to Climate Central and Zillow. Companies and residential developers continue to build on the water because that is simply where people want to live and work. Long Island City is already becoming a hot spot for New York City, and Amazon will speed that change exponentially. New York City is also running out of large spaces for developments like this one, which likely played into the choice. Amazon is more than likely considering all these risks as it plans its new headquarters, although a spokesman for the company said they could not comment on any plans. Like other waterfront buildings, the new headquarters will have to be built as a stronghold  resilient against weather and water. \"But then you have to ask how easy will it be to get to and from their headquarters, what's happening to the surrounding neighborhood? And they're going to need the city's help to fortify the whole area,\" Strauss said. -- CNBC's Erica Posse and Lisa Rizzolo   contributed to this report"

        "header": "Rising Risks: Devastating flash floods put US towns in peril, forcing real estate developers to change strategy",
        "content": "On Memorial Day weekend, a catastrophic flash flood ripped through a town founded four years before the Declaration of Independence was signed. Water crashed through walls, exploded through heavy doors and destroyed businesses up and down the once-kitschy Main Street in  Ellicott City, Maryland . It would have been called a 1,000-year flood, had the same destructive deluge not crashed through town just two years earlier. The first time, in 2016, on the city's nearly 2-century-old Main Street, shop owners like Donna Sanger worked tirelessly to rebuild. It took months, but the city and the tourists came back. \"There was this enthusiasm. Let's build, let's put on a show, let's bring the town back, we're EC strong!\" said Sanger, standing in front of her kitchen sundries store. But in 2018, the feeling is different. \"This is more like a funeral,\" she said. Business owners now say they feel like these destructive floods are the new normal. This historic town of more than 65,000 residents, barely a blip on the map, is a blueprint for developing disaster  real estate development in the face of increasingly wet weather. The overwhelming factor was intense rainstorms. \"Climate change, due to warming oceans, changing atmospheric patterns, is increasing the intensity and the frequency of intense storms, making them wetter,\" said Joe Sexton, a scientist who uses satellite images to map changes in ecosystems. Not only is more water falling, but more development is covering the natural vegetation and replacing it with impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt, along with rooftops through which water does not penetrate. Ellicott City was built just north of the Patapsco River. Several tributaries above Main Street run through town to the river. Those water currents were the currency, the energy for the town, which was built around a mill in 1772. But since 1991, real estate around the popular main drag exploded. Developers submitted more than 100 plans to build residential and commercial buildings in about 3 square miles around Ellicott City. Most were approved, according to county records. \"We have flood maps that were drawn based on predictions that are no longer true,\" Sexton said. In the most recent storm, nearly 8 inches of rain fell in just three hours  intense water with nowhere to go. Sexton's maps show how development increased the intensity of the flooding by up to 30 percent, and Ellicott City is just one example. He mapped close to 8,000 square miles between  Washington  and  Baltimore , and watched changes since 1984. The amount of land, or permeable dirt, that has been covered with impermeable streets, sidewalks and buildings is about equal to the size of the entire city of Baltimore. Sexton said cities small and large, but particularly small-town America, where sewer systems are less advanced, are in danger. And it is not just the amount of water, as heavy rains cause tributaries to overflow, it is also the speed of that water, rushing through towns like a bulldozer. The only way to control that speed is to give the river new options of where to go. And that may be the answer in Ellicott City. There are several proposals for reconstruction, but one leading idea is to level some of the historic buildings that stand by the side of the river and create a new river walk  a green space that could accommodate floodwater. \"We have to discuss whether or not the county should purchase some properties, how we can open up the stream,\" said Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman, whose jurisdiction includes Ellicott City. \"We're not going to lose this town, but we need to realize, instead of imposing ourselves on the river, how can we coexist with the river?\" Kittleman, who led the area through both floods, said he is deeply committed to keeping Main Street standing, even if that means losing some of its beautiful, historic buildings, some of which were built in the late 1700s. \"I think we have to look at what's best for the town as a whole. We have to figure out what is the best way for us to save this town,\" he added. One of those buildings houses Tom Shoemaker's family furniture business. He and his son barely escaped as the floodwaters surged through. \"The water kept coming up, and it started seeping through the doors.Then all of a sudden it just 'boom' broke the doors. And we were actually  my son and I  were here. We had got up here on the landing and able to get upstairs,\" said Shoemaker, who has lived in the area for nearly 50 years and leases space for his Main Street business. After two dangerous and destructive floods, he will move his business uphill, losing the higher profile of the street, but gaining a sense of peace. \"Well, you got to do what you have to do, you know, because this seems like a reoccurring problem right now and being down here in the flood zone is not fun. ... It's difficult. It's horrible, yeah, it is,\" he said. On the other hand, and the other side of the street, the change could benefit other businesses. Sanger owns the building that houses her business. She is invested in the town, and quickly began rebuilding her store. \"If we can get through this period of time, then it's a tremendous opportunity, too,\" Sanger said. Because taking down the opposite buildings means her property would overlook a valuable new green space  a river walk, mitigating water and attracting business to her and her neighbors. \"There's a reason why they're over here working on these streets,\" she said. \"They see the long picture, the long-term picture, and they know that if they hold on, they bring the buildings back, and the county does what we think they're going to do, that in the long run they're going to have very valuable real estate.\" In the meantime, Howard County unanimously approved a one-year freeze on new development in the areas where stormwater runs into the river underneath Main Street. About 600 housing units in various stages of permitting would be put on hold, according to county estimates. -- CNBC's Erica Posse and Lisa Rizzolo contributed to this report"
